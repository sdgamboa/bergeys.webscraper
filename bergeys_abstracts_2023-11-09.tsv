Geothrix	Rod-shaped cells 0.1 µm × 1–2 µm. Nonphotosynthetic. Nonsporeforming. Cells occur singly and in chains. Anaerobic, having an obligately anaerobic metabolism that can be either fermentative or respiratory using nitrate, Mn(IV), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), poorly crystalline iron(III) oxide, and iron(III) chelated with nitrilotriacetic acid [Fe(III)-NTA] or citrate as alternative electron acceptors. Chemoorganotrophic. Growth on yeast extract and organic acids including acetate and lactate, but not on alcohols including ethanol. Capable of fermenting organic acids including citrate and fumarate. End products of citrate fermentation are acetate and succinate. Optimal growth is 35–40°C. No growth at or below 25°C. Nonmotile. Contains c-type cytochromes.
Holophaga	Rod-shaped cells, 0.5–0.7 µm × 1–3 µm. Gram-stain-negative. Nonphotosynthetic. Nonsporeforming. Anaerobic, having strictly anaerobic metabolism that is obligately fermentative. Ferments trimethoxybenzoate and syringate to dimethylsulfide and methanediol. Ferments pyruvate and trihydroxybenzenes such as pyrogallol and gallate, as well as methylated derivatives of hydroxybenzene including 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB). Aromatics are fermented to acetate. Optimal growth is at 28–32°C. No growth below 10°C or above 35°C. Optimum growth from pH 6.8 to 7.5. No growth below pH 5.5 or above pH 8.0. Growth with NaCl from 0.1 to 1.5%. Nonmotile. Contains c-type cytochromes.
Acidimicrobium	Thermotolerant or moderately thermophilic, acidophilic bacterium. Small, rod-shaped cells, which may be in filaments of variable length. Optimum growth occurs at 45–50°C and approximately pH 2. Heterotrophic growth occurs on yeast extract, during which cells are motile. Autotrophic growth occurs on ferrous iron. Most rapid growth is observed aerobically with ferrous iron and yeast extract. Found in warm, acidic, mineral sulfide-rich environments.
Ferrimicrobium	Motile rods, Gram-stain-negative. Acidophilic, mesophilic, and obligately heterotrophic. Capable of oxidation of ferrous iron and pyrite, and reduction of ferric iron. Grows with yeast extract or a limited range of organic compounds.

Grows on yeast extract, glycerol, or ethanol. Capable of ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron reduction. Unknown growth factor(s) from yeast extract is (are) required for growth.
Iamia	Gram-stain-positive rods. Aerobic. Oxidase- and catalase-positive. Mesophilic. The predominant menaquinone is MK-9(H6). The major whole-cell fatty acids are C17:0, C17:1 ω8c, C15:0, and C16:0. Isolated from the epidermis of a sea cucumber and grown on marine agar.
