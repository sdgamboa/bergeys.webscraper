Actinomyces	Straight or slightly curved rods, 0.2–1.0 µm in diameter, which vary considerably in shape and size, and slender filaments, 1 µm or less in width and 10–50 µm or more in length, with true branching. Short rods (0.5–5.0 µm in length) with or without clubbed ends are frequently seen and may occur singly, in pairs with diphtheroidal arrangements (Y, V, T forms and palisades), in short chains or in small clusters. Longer (5.0–10.0 µm in length) branched rods are also common. Several members of the genus appear chiefly or exclusively as coccobacillary or even coccoid elements. Filaments which may predominate in certain species are either straight or wavy, show varying degrees of branching and may have swollen, clubbed, or clavate ends. Gram-stain-positive, but irregular staining giving rise to a beaded or barred appearance frequently occurs, and two species may be Gram-stain-variable. Non-acid-fast, nonmotile, and non-endospore-forming. Conidia are not produced.
Arcanobacterium	Slender, irregular, bacillary forms predominate during the first 18 h of growth; many cells are arranged at an angle to give V-formations. As growth proceeds cells become granular and segmented so that they resemble small and irregular cocci. Both rods and coccoid cells are Gram-stain-positive, non-acid fast and non-motile; endospores are not formed. Facultatively anaerobic; growth is considerably enhanced in an atmosphere of increased CO2-tension. Growth is sparse on ordinary media but enhanced by blood or serum. The optimum temperature for growth is 37°C. Organisms will not withstand heating at 60°C for 15 min. Chemoorganotrophic, having a fermentative type of carbohydrate metabolism. Fermentation end products include acetic and lactic acids; the amount of succinic acid produced may vary from species to species and may even be difficult to detect. Catalase-negative. Nitrate reduction is usually negative. Characteristic amino acids of the cell-wall peptidoglycan of those species whose peptidoglycan has been examined in detail are based on L-lysine. Other chemotaxonomic properties include rhamnose as diagnostic whole-cell sugar, lack of mycolic acids and N-acetylated muramic acid residue of the peptidoglycan.
Mobiluncus	Curved rods with tapered ends, 1–5 × 0.4–0.6 µm. Depending on the growth medium, cells occur singly or in pairs with a gullwing appearance. Gram-stain-negative or Gram-stain-variable. Cells are motile by means of multiple subpolar flagella (exact numbers are yet to be determined, but are thought to be between one and eight), and possess a multi-layered Gram-stain-positive cell-wall type. Endospores are not formed. Anaerobic, growing best in an enriched CO2 atmosphere. Some strains become aerotolerant after several passages, being able to grow in a partially reduced atmosphere containing 5% O2. Optimum growth at 35–37°C, with no or poor growth at 20, 43, or 45°C. Growth is stimulated by horse or rabbit serum and by whole blood. Growth is not stimulated by formate/fumarate. Slow growth on solid media.

Actinopolyspora	Aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, acid-fast, nonmotile actinomycetes that form an extensively branched substrate mycelium about 1 µm in diameter. Fragmentation of the substrate mycelium is occasionally observed near the colony center, but substrate hyphae are mostly non-fragmented. Sporophores containing 10 or more smooth-walled coccobacillary and coccoid spores are produced basipetally on aerial hyphae. Spores are not observed on the substrate mycelium. Chemoorganotrophic and halophilic; 10–20% (w/v) NaCl is required for optimal growth. Temperature growth range is 30–50°C. Whole-organism hydrolyzates contain meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-A2pm), arabinose, and galactose. Muramic acid moieties are N-acetylated. Cells contain phosphatidylcholine as the diagnostic phospholipid and are rich in branched-chain fatty acids, notably C17:0 anteiso and C15:0 iso, but lack mycolic acids. The predominant menaquinones are MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H6).
Aeriscardovia	Gram-stain-positive, catalase- and oxidase-negative, nonmotile, non-spore-forming actinomycete that forms short and irregularly shaped rods. Optimal growth occurs under anaerobic conditions, with aerobic growth yielding elongated cells. Isolated from a porcine cecum. 16S rRNA and HSP60 gene sequence comparisons indicate that Aeriscardovia belongs to the family Bifidobacteriaceae. Only the type species, Aeriscardovia aeriphila, has been described.
Alloscardovia	Gram-stain-positive, catalase- and oxidase-negative, nonmotile, non-spore-forming actinomycete that forms short irregularly shaped rods. Optimal growth occurs under anaerobic conditions on modified Columbia agar (MCA) or modified de Man–Rogosa–Sharpe medium (mMRS) after 24 h at 37°C, but slow aerobic growth (72 h), producing pinpoint-sized colonies, is also observed on MCA. Isolated from various human clinical samples, but data are not currently available on potential pathogenic relevance or virulence factors. On the basis of 16S rRNA and HSP60 gene sequence analyses, Alloscardovia represents a new genus of the family Bifidobacteriaceae. Only one species has been described, Alloscardovia omnicolens.
Bifidobacterium	Rods of various shapes: short, regular, thin cells with pointed ends, coccoidal regular cells, or long cells with slight bends or protuberances or with a large variety of branching; pointed, with slightly bifurcated club-shaped or spatulated extremities; may occur singly or in chains of many elements; may occur in star-like aggregates or in “V” or “palisade” arrangements. Colonies are smooth, convex with entire edges, cream to white, glistening, and of soft consistency. Gram-stain-positive, non-acid-fast, nonsporeforming, and nonmotile. Cells often stain irregularly with methylene blue. Anaerobic; some species can tolerate O2, but only in the presence of CO2 and the more recently described species, such as Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, Bifidobacterium scardovii, and Bifidobacterium tsurumiense, can grow under aerobic conditions (Okamoto et al., 2008). Optimum growth temperature is 37–41°C, except for Bifidobacterium mongoliense, which exhibits an optimal growth temperature of 30°C; minimum growth temperature is 25–28°C, with the exception of Bifidobacterium mongoliense and Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, which can grow at 15°C and 8°C, respectively; maximum growth temperature is 43–45°C, with the exception of Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum, which exhibits a maximal growth temperature of 49.5°C. Growth at 45°C seems to discriminate between animal and human strains, since most of the animal but not the human strains are able to grow at this temperature (Gavini et al., 1991). Optimum pH for initial growth is 6.5–7.0; does not grow at pH 4.5–5.0 (except for Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum, which can grow at pH 4.5) or pH 8.0–8.5.

Fermentation products from glucose are acetic and L-(+)-lactic acids in the molar ratio 3:2. 16S rRNA and HSP60 gene sequence data place Metascardovia in the family Bifidobacteriaceae. One species, Metascardovia criceti, has been described.
Parascardovia	Gram-stain-positive, non-acid-fast. Nonsporeforming. Nonmotile, small, slender rods of variable shape. Anaerobic. Saccharoclastic. Glucose is degraded exclusively and characteristically by the fructose 6-phosphate (F6PPK; EC 4.1.2.22) shunt (see treatment of the genus Bifidobacterium, above). Fermentation products from glucose are acetic acid and L-(+)-lactic acid in the molar ratio of 2:1. Dextran is fermented by most strains. Found in human dental caries and plaque. 16S rRNA and HSP60 gene sequence analyses have shown that the genus Parascardovia belongs to the family Bifidobacteriaceae. The type and only species is Parascardovia denticolens.
Scardovia	Gram-stain-positive, non-acid-fast. Nonsporeforming. Nonmotile, anaerobic, rod-shaped cells that are small and coccoid and of variable shape. Saccharoclastic.

Some species acidophilic. Optimal temperature is 25–30°C. Peptidoglycan contains LL-diaminopimelic acid and glycine (A3γ type sensu Schleifer and Kandler, 1972) plus glutamic acid and alanine. Arabinose is common to all, although additional sugars complete the whole-cell sugar pattern in the different species. Predominant menaquinones are MK-9 (H8), (H6), (H4), in different amounts depending on the species. Predominant fatty acids are saturated C16 iso and C17 anteiso. Polar lipids containing glucosamine are not detected. Natural habitat is soil.

Mycobacterium	Aerobic to microaerophilic, slightly curved or straight rods (0.2–0.6 × 1.0–10 µm), which are acid–alcohol-fast at some stage of growth. Most species are difficult to stain by Gram's method, but are usually considered Gram-stain-positive. Branching may sometimes occur and a filamentous or mycelium-like growth may appear which, on slight disturbance, becomes fragmented into rods or coccoid elements. Cells are nonmotile and asporogenous; conidia or capsules are not produced; there are no grossly visible aerial hyphae. Colonies may be white- to cream-colored; some strains produce yellow- or orange-pigmented colonies with or without light stimulation. Whole-organism hydrolysates are rich in meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose, and galactose. The peptidoglycan is of the A1γ type. Muramic acid moieties are N-glycolated. Cells and cell walls are rich in lipids. These include waxes which have characteristic, chloroform-soluble, mycolic acids with long (60–90 carbon atoms) branched chains.

Cells contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phospatidylinositol mannosides as predominant polar lipids, straight-chain saturated, unsaturated, and 10-methyloctadecanoic (tuberculostearic) fatty acids as major fatty acid components, and dihydrogenated menaquinones with nine isoprene units as the predominant isoprenolog. The genus includes obligate parasites, saprophytes, and opportunistic forms.
Gordonia	Aerobic, Gram-stain-positive to Gram-stain-variable, nonspore-forming actinomycetes that are usually partially acid–alcoholfast. Nonmotile, short rods and cocci (0.5–1.0 × 1.0–2.5 µm) occur singly, in pairs, in V-shaped arrangements, or as short chains. Elementary branched hyphae which fragment into rod- and coccoid-like elements are formed by some species.

Chemo-organotrophic with an oxidative type of metabolism. Mycobactins are formed. Catalase-positive, arylsulfatase-negative, and sensitive to lysozyme. Most strains grow well between 20 and 37°C.
Millisia	Aerobic, Gram-stain-positive to Gram-stain-variable, acid–alcohol-fast, nonmotile, catalase-positive actinomycete that forms non-sporing rods which show only rudimentary right-angled branching and which contain polyphosphate storage granules. In stationary phase, the rods fragment into spherical unicells (Figure 1). Salmon pink, irregular colonies with filamentous margins and sparse unbranched aerial hyphae are formed on glucose-yeast extract agar. Colonies are matt and dry in appearance, soft in texture, and easy to emulsify. Diffusible pigments are not produced. Whole-organism hydrolysates are rich in meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose, and galactose. The organism contains N-glycolated muramic acid residues, a predominant dihydrogenated menaquinone with eight isoprene units, and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides as major polar lipids. Mycolic acids have 44–52 carbon atoms (principal components C48, C50, and C52), and oleic, palmitic, and palmitoleic acids are the predominant fatty acids, with relatively small amounts of myristic, stearic, and tuberculostearic acids. A member of the family Nocardiaceae in the order Corynebacteriales.
Nocardia	Aerobic, Gram-stain-positive to Gram-stain-variable, nonmotile catalase-positive actinomycetes which are typically acid–alcohol-fast at some stages of the growth cycle. Rudimentary to extensively branched, substrate hyphae that often fragment in situ or on mechanical disruption into coccoid to rod-shaped, nonmotile elements. Aerial hyphae, at times visible only microscopically, are almost always present. Colonial appearance is variable; colonies may be smooth to granular and irregular, wrinkled or heaped. Carotenoid-like pigments confer various shades of orange, pink, red, or yellow to colonies growing on solid culture media. Soluble brown or yellowish diffusible pigments may be produced. Chemo-organotrophic with an oxidative type of carbohydrate metabolism. Arylsulfatase-negative. Most strains grow well from 20°C up to 45°C.
Rhodococcus	Aerobic, Gram-stain-positive to Gram-stain-variable, nonmotile actinomycetes that are usually partially acid–alcohol-fast at some stage of the growth cycle. Rods to extensively branched substrate mycelium may be formed. In all strains the growth cycle begins with the coccus or short rod stage, with different organisms showing a succession of more or less complex morphological stages by which the completion of the cycle is achieved. Cocci may germinate into short rods, form filaments with side projections, show elementary branching, or, in the most differentiated forms, produce extensively branched hyphae. The next generation of cocci and short rods are formed by fragmentation of the rods, filaments, and hyphae. Some strains form sparse microscopically visible aerial hyphae, which may be branched, or aerial synnemata consisting of unbranched filaments that coalesce and project upwards. Colonies may be rough, smooth, or mucoid and pigmented buff, cream, orange, red, or yellow, although colorless variants occur. Chemo-organotrophic with an oxidative type of metabolism. Catalase-positive, arylsulfatase-negative, and sensitive to lysozyme. Most strains grow well on standard media between 15 and 40°C, and use a wide range of organic compounds as sole sources of carbon for energy and growth.

Tuberculostearic acid is present in large amounts (>20% of the whole-cell fatty acids). The major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol. Dihydrogenated menaquinone with nine isoprene units is the only isoprenologue. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, it is a member of the family Gordoniaceae.

Isolated from 55–60°C acidic water and mud samples in Yellowstone National Park in the course of a screening program to obtain thermostable cellulases. Cells may be stored in 20% (v/v) glycerol in LPBM medium at −80°C, and thawed on ice.
Cryptosporangium	Gram-stain-positive, non-acid-fast, aerobic organisms with branching hyphae. Non-fragmentary substrate mycelia are present. The sporangia and aerial mycelia aggregate (Figure 109) and sporangiospores show motility when they are suspended in water. Morphology of a 2-week-old culture grown on inorganic salts-starch agar shows the presence of aerial mycelia. Strictly aerobic. Good growth occurs at 20–25°C. The organism shows good growth on oatmeal agar, inorganic salts-starch agar, and peptone-yeast extract iron agar. In general, the vegetative mycelia are yellow to orange and the aerial mycelia are white. Cell walls contain glutamic acid, glucosamine, glycine, alanine, and meso-DAP.

Single cells may be motile rods and vibroid or non-motile cocci that tend to form aggregates. Strains may form motile zoospores. Formation of buds on rods is common, but not universal. Membranous bodies, 1–4 per cell, which are linked to the cytoplasmic membrane, may be present. Oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, and aerobic; some strains may be microaerophilic.

Arabinose and galactose have been identified as whole-cell sugars in one species. Phylogenetically, a member of the family Geodermatophilaceae.
Geodermatophilus	Morphology is similar to that of Dermatophilus, a group of actinobacteria that have rudimentary hyphae (Figure 1) that eventually develop into complex sporangia (Figure 2). Geodermatophilus strains have been isolated from relatively extreme environments such as desert or high altitude soils. They also appear to resist gamma irradiation and have been recovered from desert soils after exposure to 30 kGy, along with strains of Deinococcus that are more noted for radiation resistance (Rainey et al., 2005). They have been recovered during programs aimed at isolating bacteria, in particular motile ones (Hayakawa et al., 2000), that have atypical metabolic features such as manganese-oxidizing ability, and are frequently associated with “varnish” formation, the black to brown coatings found on rocks in a diverse range of environments (Hungate et al., 1987) and, more surprisingly, in biofilm formation (Singh et al., 2003). Despite several trials, pathogenic lesions have not been produced by inoculation of Geodermatophilus isolates into rabbits (Gordon and Perrin, 1971). These trials had been attempted given the morphological and ontogenetic similarities with Dermatophilus. It is now known these morphological similarities constitute a case of convergent evolution of a few remarkable features rather than phylogenetic similarity.

The chains may be branched (rarely). Cells in the chain look asymmetrical with constricted separations between cells. No substrate mycelium is formed. The aerial mycelium forms rod-shaped to coccoid spores that may develop polar flagella when grown in liquid media. Under nitrogen-replete conditions, spores swell to yield various forms, some of which are vaguely fish-like, hence the name initially given to the genus.

Mature colonies have a gelatinous matrix that confers a glossy appearance. Spores, which are spherical to ovoid or pyriform with a long axis of 1±2 µm, are catenated around the central projection or are located singly or in aggregates at the tips of hyphae. The spores are motile with polar tufts of flagella (Figure 2). The peptidoglycan contains either almost equivalent amounts of LL- and meso-DAP or mainly LL- or meso-DAP.

Ziehl–Neelsen stain (acid-fastness) is negative. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is positive (red color). Does not grow in standard microbiological media; growth in laboratory animals has not been described. Grows in tissue culture medium in co-culture with human fibroblasts (La Scola, Fenollar, Fournier, Altwegg, Mallet and Raoult, 2001), as well as axenically in tissue culture medium supplemented with extra amino acids (Renesto, Crapoulet, Ogata, La Scola, Vestris, Claverie and Raoult, 2003). Intact cells in culture are observed in intra- and extracellular locations. Grows at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere; anaerobic or completely aerobic growth unknown. Nonmotile.

Members have not yet been obtained in cell culture.
“Candidatus Piscichlamydia”	Coccoid to rod shaped, nonmotile, obligately intracellular bacteria, up to 1.8 μm in length.
Chlamydia	Coccoid, nonmotile, obligate intracellular organisms, 0.2–1.5 μm in diameter that parasitize and multiply in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells within membrane bound vacuoles, termed inclusions, by a unique developmental cycle. The cycle is characterized by physical changes in the outer membrane and nucleoid structure of metabolically inert elementary bodies that change into larger metabolically active reticulate bodies that divide by binary fission. The cycle is complete when reticulate bodies reorganize into intermediate bodies then to elementary bodies that exit the host cells and start a new generation of the developmental cycle. In a young inclusion, only reticulate bodies are present. However in a mature inclusion, all three forms (reticulate, intermediate, and elementary bodies) are present because the developmental cycle is not synchronized. The intracellular survival of the organism is facilitated by its ability to prevent fusion of lysosomes to chlamydia-containing inclusions by an unknown mechanism.
Criblamydia	Coccoid to pleomorphic, nonmotile, obligately intracellular bacteria, 0.5–1 μm in diameter. Cells show a developmental cycle with morphologically distinct stages and grow within host-derived vacuoles.

Organisms naturally infect the amoeba Hartmannella vermiformis , but no other free-living amoebae including the Acanthamoeba species tested; the only exception was the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum Berg25. The genus Neochlamydia currently contains a single species, Neochlamydia hartmannellae (Figure 1) (Horn et al., 2000).
Parachlamydia	Coccoid, nonmotile, obligate intracellular bacteria, 0.4–0.6 μm in diameter. Cells show a developmental cycle with morphologically distinct stages and grow within host-derived vacuoles.

A number of additional symbionts of Acanthamoeba species closely related to. Parachlamydia acanthamoebae have been identified but not described in greater detail (Amann et al., 1997; Collingro et al., 2005a; Heinz et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2006).
Protochlamydia	Coccoid, nonmotile, obligately intracellular bacteria, 0.5–1 μm. Cells show a developmental cycle with morphologically distinct stages and grow within host-derived vacuoles. Organisms naturally infect amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba . The genus Protochlamydia currently contains a single species, Protochlamydia amoebophila (Figure 1) (Collingro, Toenshoff, Taylor, Fritsche, Wagner and Horn, 2005b; Fritsche, Horn, Wagner, Herwig, Schleifer and Gautom, 2000). A 16S rRNA gene sequence showing 97% similarity with the 16S rRNA gene of Protochlamydia amoebophila has been deposited at GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ (DQ632609). This sequence represents a second species within the genus Protochlamydia, tentatively named Protochlamydia naegleriophila (Casson, Michel, Goy, Müller and Greub, unpublished), but no further details have yet been published.
Rhabdochlamydia	Coccoid to rod shaped, nonmotile, obligately intracellular bacteria, 0.35–4 μm. Cells show a developmental cycle with morphologically distinct stages and grow within host-derived vacuoles. Organisms naturally infect arthropods and are differentiated from all other chlamydiae by the rod-shaped elementary body, which has a five-layer cell wall and shows one or two electron-translucent oblong structures in the cytoplasm (Figure 1). The genus Rhabdochlamydia is based on the description of “ Candidatus Rhabdochlamydia porcellionis” and Rhabdochlamydia crassificans (Corsaro et al., 2007; Kostanjšek et al., 2004) (Figure 2).
“Candidatus Fritschea”	Coccoid to rod-shaped, nonmotile, obligately intracellular bacteria, up to 2.5 μm in length.

The photosynthetic apparatus includes antenna structures of the chlorosome type, ovoid vesicles underlying and attached to the cytoplasmic membrane (Figures 1 and 2). Cells contain gas vacuoles.
Chlorobium	Cells spherical, ovoid, straight, or curved rod shaped, 0.3–1.1 µm wide and 0.4–3 µm long (sometimes much longer). Cells are often united in chains resembling streptococci or filaments; curved rod-shaped strains may form long spirals. Multiplication by binary fission. Nonmotile, Gram negative. The existing species exhibit one of two clearly distinguishable colors: culture or cell material is either green (grass green) or brown (chocolate brown). Significantly, these colors can also be recognized under the light microscope with bright-field illumination. Photosynthetic pigments are located in the cytoplasmic membrane and the chlorosomes (Staehelin et al., 1978), which underlie and are attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. Bacteriochlorophylls (BChl) c, d, or e occur as major photosynthetic pigments, in addition to small amounts of BChl a. Chlorobactene or isorenieratene are the major carotenoid components (Schmidt and Schiburr, 1 9 7 0).
Chloroherpeton	Long rods, 8–20 × 1 µm. Cells separate promptly after division, and no septa are seen in units (Figures 1 and 2). Cells tend to grow in clumps and produce some extracellular slime. Gram negative. Gliding motility, 10 µm/min at 20°C. Cells flex up to 180°.
Pelodictyon	Cells rod shaped to ovoid, occurring singly or in netlike or more or less spherical aggregates. Multiplication is by binary fission. Branching may occur as a result of ternary fission. Nonmotile. Gram negative. Cells regularly contain gas vacuoles. Cultures or cell material is either green or brown. Photosynthetic pigments are located in the cytoplasmic membrane and the chlorosomes, which underlie and are attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. Bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c, d, or e occurs as the major photosynthetic pigment, in addition to small amounts of BChl a. Chlorobactene or isorenieratene is the major carotenoid component (Schmidt and Schiburr, 1970; Gorlenko, 1972).
Prosthecochloris	Spherical to ovoid bacteria forming nonbranching prosthecae and multiplying by binary fission in various directions. When separation is incomplete, cells form groups and branched chains, the configuration of which depends on the direction of fission. Nonmotile. Gram negative. Cell suspensions appear green or chocolate-brown. Cells contain bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c, d, or e as the major bacteriochlorophyll component, and carotenoids. The photosynthetic apparatus includes antenna structures and chlorosomes, i.e., elongated ovoid vesicles underlying and attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. Cells do not contain gas vacuoles.

Addendum to the Green Sulfur Bacteria Phototrophic green sulfur bacteria living in consortia with other microorganisms	NA
Chloroflexus	Filaments of indefinite length; cells 0.5–1.5 × 2–6 µm; none differentiated (Figure 1). Cell division by fission, no branching. No internal proliferations of cell membrane, except mesosomes; chlorosomes present when anaerobically grown. Motile by gliding. Thin sheath may be present. Stain Gram-negative, but cell wall not typical of Gram-negative bacteria. No flagella.
Chloronema	Cells cylindrical, combined in a trichome surrounded by a sheath. Trichomes straight or spiral, appear yellow-green (Figure 1). Cells multiply by separation of sections of trichomes (hormogonia) of varying length. Gliding motility. The major pigment is bacteriochlorophyll d ; also contain bacteriochlorophyll c. The primary pigment-bearing structures are chlorosomes. Cells are capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis.
Heliothrix	Clearly septate filaments of indefinite length, unbranched and undifferentiated. Cells about 1.5 µm in diameter, much longer than broad (Figure 1). Thin sheath present or not. Cell division by fission, in one plane only. Gliding motility, rapid aggregation of suspended filaments into tight clumps, no flagella. Cells granular, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate inclusions present; gas vacuoles unknown. Cells stain Gram-negative. Bacteriochlorophyll a present, but no accessory bacteriochlorophylls or chlorosomes.

Trichomes uniformly wide throughout their length, length variable, nonbranching, with or without sheath. Trichomes multiply by separation of short segments or single cells from the parent trichome. Cells usually contain gas vacuoles. Cells stain Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Trichomes appear green or yellow-green. Contain bacteriochlorophylls c and a as well as carotenoids. The light-harvesting structures of the photosynthetic apparatus are chlorosomes. Photolithoheterotrophic or photolithoautotrophic under anaerobic conditions; capable of photosynthesis in the presence of hydrogen sulfide during which they deposit elemental sulfur globules outside the cells. Some strains are capable of growth under microaerobic conditions.
Herpetosiphon	Herpetosiphon is represented currently by two species that are unbranched, flexible filaments or rods, 0.5–1.5 × 5–150 µm or more (to several mm), consisting of individual cells 2–3 µm long. Appearance of short, transparent “sheaths” extending from ends of some filaments are termed sleeves by Reichenbach (1992) and are characteristic of Herpetosiphon. They may not be true sheaths, but rather the “ghosts” of necridial (dead) cells of the filament (Reichenbach, 1992). Since gliding motility of whole filaments occurs, it is unlikely that a true sheath could exist at that point. Resting stages are unknown. Gram-negative. Cells contain peptidoglycan in which meso-diaminopimelic acid is replaced by l-ornithine. In addition, the outer membrane is lacking (together with its lipopolysaccharide component). Motile by gliding.
Chrysiogenes	Curved, rod-shaped cells with rounded ends, 1.0–2.0 µm in length and 0.50–0.75 µm in diameter. Gram-negative. Each cell is motile by a single polar flagellum. Strictly anaerobic. In agar, colonies are small, round-lenticular with entire edges, convex and white. In liquid medium, cells form swarms of motile bacteria. The optimum temperature for growth is between 25 and 30°C. Cells grow in defined minimal medium by anaerobic respiration with acetate as the electron donor and carbon source and arsenate as the electron acceptor. Acetate is oxidized to CO2. Arsenate is reduced to arsenite. Phylogenetically, the genus is the first representative of a new deeply branching lineage of the Bacteria.

Pyrodictium	Cells disk- to dish-shaped, highly variable in diameter, ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 µm, frequently with ultraflat areas, about 0.1–0.2 µm thick (Figure 1). Produce tubule-shaped structures (“cannulae”), 0.025 µm thick, which form networks connecting the cells (Figure 2). Strictly and facultatively chemolithotrophic.

S-layer of the cell envelope consists of protein subunits arranged in a p4 lattice. Membrane contains glycerol-dialkyl-glycerol-tetraether.

Growth between pH 1 and 5.5 (Brock et al., 1972; Brock, 1978). Based on 16S rRNA sequence data, the Sulfolobus species are distributed over several branches within the Sulfolobales (Sulfolobaceae), indicating that they do not represent one cluster (genus) within this order (family) (Fuchs et al., 1996a).
Sulfurisphaera	Cells are irregular cocci, 1.2–1.5 μm in diameter. Gram-negative. Facultatively anaerobic heterotroph. Envelope surrounding the cell membrane.

Caldivirga	Straight or slightly curved rods, occasionally bent or branching, either singly or extensively. Most cells are 0.4–0.7 × 3–20 µm. Often, spherical bodies protrude at the end of the cells, or laterally. Cells multiply by branching or budding, and divide by constriction. Pili attach to cells terminally or laterally. Nonmotile. Grows anaerobically or microaerobically. Optimum growth at high temperature (85°C) and weakly acidic conditions (pH 3.7–4.2). Resistant to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, oleandomycin, and streptomycin. Sensitive to erythromycin, novobiocin, and rifampicin. Possesses at least five cyclized glycerol-bisphytanyl-glycerol tetraethers. The 16S rDNA is typical of a chrenarchaeote in the signature sequence analysis. Phylogenetically represents an independent lineage in the family Thermoproteaceae. Isolated from acidic hot springs. Monospecific at present.
Pyrobaculum	Rod-shaped, almost rectangular cells. During growth, the rods form aggregates arranged in a V-shape with various angles. X- and raft-shaped aggregates occur. Rods form terminal spheres. Cells usually 0.5–0.6 × 1.5–8 µm. Gram negative. No murein present. No spores formed. No cell septa. Cells surrounded by a single or double S-layer of protein subunits, arranged on a p6 lattice.

Multiply by branching and budding and can divide by constriction. Gram-negative. Anaerobic or microaerobic heterotrophic thermophile growing between 60 and 80°C and pH 3.0 and 5.9. Best growth occurs at 75°C at pH 4.2. Possesses at least five tetraether core lipids with cyclopentane rings in the isopranyl chains. Sensitive to rifampicin but not to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, or oleandomycin.
Thermoproteus	Rigid rods of ~0.4 μm in diameter and from <1 to ~100 μm in length. No cell septa. Otherwise, the description is the same as that for the family.
Subsection I	NA
Form-Chamaesiphon	Unicellular cyanobacteria that reproduce exclusively by successive unequal binary fission (budding) at the apical pole of ovoid, club-shaped, or pyriform cells. The small spherical buds are produced in succession at one pole of the mother cell. This mode of reproduction confers an intrinsic heteropolarity on the cell.
Form-Chroococcus	Large cells (22–32 µm in diameter) that reproduce by binary fission in two successive planes at right angles; the cells occur in aggregates, generally of four cells, held together by multilaminated sheath material. Due to the constraints imposed by the tightly appressed sheath layers, a single, spherical, predivisional cell gives rise to hemispherical and quadrantal cells after the first and second cell divisions, respectively.
Form-Cyanobacterium	Unicellular cyanobacteria that reproduce by transverse binary fission in a single plane. Cells are spherical to rod-shaped, 1.7–2.3 µm in diameter. Thylakoids are parallel and located throughout the cell.
Form- Cyanobium	Unicellular cyanobacteria that reproduce by transverse binary fission in a single plane. Cells are spherical to rod-shaped, 0.8–1.4 µm in diameter and contain peripheral thylakoids.
Form-Cyanothece	The form-genus Cyanothece is a provisional assemblage of strains loosely defined as unicellular coccoid to rod-shaped cyanobacteria that divide by transverse binary fission in a single plane. The cells are ~3 µm or greater in width and lack structured (e.g., laminated) sheaths.
Form- Dactylococcopsis	Unicellular cyanobacteria that are fusiform in shape. The cells are 4–8 × 35–80 µm. Dividing or paired cells may be up to 135 µm long. A well-defined sheath is absent; gas vacuoles present along cell margins, but are most abundant at the mature (pointed) ends of the cell. The only axenic isolate (PCC 8305) is halophilic and halotolerant.
Form- Gloeobacter	Unicellular cyanobacteria that possess oval- to rod-shaped cells that divide by transverse binary fission in a single plane. Cells occur in irregular aggregates held together by sheath material. Intracellular photosynthetic thylakoids are lacking; the light-harvesting and photosynthetic apparatus is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
Form- Gloeocapsa	Unicellular cyanobacteria with spherical cells 3–10 µm in diameter that divide by binary fission in two or three successive planes at right angles to one another and occur in aggregates that are held together by a multilaminated sheath.
Form- Gloeothece	Unicellular rod-shaped cyanobacteria that divide by transverse binary fission in a single plane, the cells being united into aggregates by well defined, often laminated, sheath layers.
Form-Microcystis	Planktonic unicellular cyanobacteria that reproduce by binary fission in two (or possibly three?) planes at right angles to one another. Cells are spherical, 3–6 µm in diameter. May be united into colonial aggregates by mucilage, but are never enclosed by multilaminated sheath material. Gas vesicles are normally present.
Form- Prochlorococcus	Marine planktonic cyanobacteria that possess spherical to slightly rod-shaped cells (0.5–0.8 × 0.7–1.6 µm) and divide by binary fission in a single plane. They lack phycobilisomes and contain divinyl-chlorophyll a and b (a 2 and b 2).
Form- Prochloron	Unicellular, spherical, without evident mucilaginous sheath. Reproduction by binary fission. Almost exclusively extracellular symbionts of colonial ascidians (chiefly didemnids) on subtropical marine shores. Form chlorophylls a and b and lack phycobiliproteins.
Form- Synechococcus	This form-genus serves as a provisional repository for unicellular cyanobacteria that share the morphological properties of members assignable to the botanical genus Synechococcus Nägeli 1849. Cells are spherical to rod shaped, 0.6–2.1 µm in diameter and contain photosynthetic thylakoids located peripherally. Reproduction occurs by transverse binary fission in a single plane. The cells may be united into colonial aggregates by mucilage formation, but never produce well defined sheath layers.
Form- Synechocystis	Cyanobacteria of this provisional form-genus are unicellular strains that possess spherical cells 2–6 µm in diameter and reproduce by binary fission in two or three successive planes at right angles. Cells typically occur singly or in pairs in culture; but in nature (and rarely in culture) may occur in aggregates held together by amorphous slime material; well-defined sheath layers are never produced. Gas vacuoles are absent.
Subsection II	NA
Form- Cyanocystis	Unicellular cyanobacteria that have apical-basal polarity (i.e., ovoid to pyriform in shape), and that reproduce only by multiple fission (i.e., do not exhibit binary fission). Baeocytes are immotile, possessing an outer fibrous wall layer at the time of release from the parental cell.
Form- Dermocarpella	Cyanobacteria that undergo binary fission to form an ovoid aggregate consisting of a large apical cell and from one to three smaller basal cells. The cell aggregate possesses an intrinsic apical-basal polarity. Multiple fission occurs initially in the apical part of the small cell aggregate, followed by the release of baeocytes that do not possess an outer fibrous layer, and which may exhibit gliding motility. The baeocytes enlarge asymmetrically into ovoid vegetative cells before initiating binary fission. After the initial round of multiple fission, the remaining basal cells enlarge asymmetrically and undergo binary fission to form apical reproductive cells and smaller basal cells; multiple fission is reinitiated in the new apical cells.
Form- Stanieria	This genus encompasses unicellular cyanobacteria that are generally spherical in shape, not exhibiting intrinsic heteropolarity. Reproduction occurs exclusively by multiple fission. The baeocytes lack a fibrous outer wall layer and therefore are generally motile.
Form- Xenococcus	Unicellular cyanobacteria that reproduce exclusively by multiple fission, leading to the formation and release of baeocytes that possess a fibrous outer wall and are therefore nonmotile. The baeocyte enlarges into a spherical vegetative cell. The successive cleavage stages of multiple fission are readily detectable by light microscopy.
Form- Chroococcidiopsis	Cyanobacteria that undergo repeated binary fission in three planes to produce more or less regular cubical cell aggregates. Multiple fission occurs simultaneously in most cells of the aggregate and is followed by the release of nonmotile baeocytes which possess an outer fibrous wall layer. The baeocytes differ little in diameter from mature parental cells and enlarge symmetrically into a spherical vegetative cells that, just before the onset of binary fission, attain dimensions characteristic and constant for any given strain.
Form- Myxosarcina	Cyanobacteria that undergo repeated binary fission in three planes to form more or less cubical aggregates of cells. Multiple fission occurs simultaneously in most vegetative cells, resulting in the liberation of a restricted number (about four per vegetative cell) of baeocytes that lack an outer fibrous wall layer and are often capable of gliding motility. The baeocytes enlarge symmetrically into spherical vegetative cells that, just prior to the onset of binary fission, attain a size that is characteristic and constant for any given strain.
Pleurocapsa-group	The Pleurocapsa-group is a provisional assemblage which can loosely be defined as cyanobacteria that undergo repeated binary fissions in many different planes to produce cell aggregates that are diverse in size and form. They range from smaller or larger cell aggregates of variable compactness to very complex structures, all of which exhibit at the periphery pseudofilamentous appendages of varying length. Multiple fission occurs in some cells of the aggregates, resulting in baeocytes which may be motile because they lack a fibrous wall layer at the time of release.
Subsection III	NA
Form- Arthrospira	The entire trichome is arranged as an open helix, in which cross-walls may be seen via light microscopy, but not too easily when gas vacuoles are abundant (Figure 1). However, the vesicles can be easily collapsed by centrifugation or by exerting pressure on a suspension in a plastic syringe by pushing against a rubber stopper. Cells are generally shorter than broad or isodiametric. Slight constrictions at crosswalls may be present or absent. In some strains the terminal cells may acquire a cap-like thickening of the outer cell wall, termed a calyptra. A single circle of junctional pores (i.e., near crosswalls) seems to be typical for members of this genus, and fimbriae are closely appressed along the trichome (E.M.) (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1982a, b). Persistent sheaths are not produced. Gliding motility is evident in most strains. Thylakoids have a radial arrangement in trichome cross-section. Trichome width among the numerous isolates in culture varies from about 5–12 µm, although smaller forms (3 µm) have been described from nature. The helix is an open spiral with wave amplitudes ranging from 30 to 60 µm, with interhelical spacing of similar dimensions (Ciferri, 1983; Ciferri and Tiboni, 1985). On solid medium, the helix undergoes a transition to a “flat spiral”. Considerable variation in degree of helix pitch occurs within some strains, and culture variants that are nearly straight are also found (Jeeji-Bai, 1985; R. Rippka, unpublished).
Form- Borzia	This genus is characterized by very short trichomes of 2–8 (16) cells, with conspicuous constrictions at crosswalls, of various diameters; motility slight or lacking; cells usually shorter than broad. This last characteristic seems to be the main feature separating this genus from Pseudanabaena (as represented in this volume), since many strains of Pseudanabaena consistently exhibit comparably short trichomes. Brevitrichomy may also occur in other filamentous cyanobacteria (Pinevich et al., 1997), and mutants with short trichomes have been isolated from heterocystous forms such as Anabaena (Bauer et al., 1995). Thus this property may be trivial, which could be demonstrated by genetic analyses on typical representatives of this “genus”. Hormoscilla Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988 is very similar to Borzia and will not be considered here. A species isolated by E.G. Pringsheim and conforming to the description of Borzia trilocularis (Pringsheim, 1968) exists in culture strain SAG B 1407–1, but has been assigned to Hormoscilla pringsheimii (Schlösser, 1994).
Form- Crinalium	Members of this genus share structural similarities with Oscillatoria. The trichome is flattened to elliptical in cross-section rather than cylindrical (or triradiate as in Starria). The only representative in axenic culture (strain PCC 9333), described as Crinalium epipsammum (SAG 22.89), has short cells (1–1.5 µm) that are 2–2.5 µm in narrow width and 5–7 µm in breadth (De Winder et al., 1990). The terminal cells are undifferentiated. Binary fission as in Oscillatoria. Trichomes are nonmotile. As seen in transmission electron microscopy, thylakoids are mainly parallel to the long axis and close to the cell periphery. The cell wall peptidoglycan layer is thick (80–100 nm). Reported to have a mean DNA base composition of 33.9 mol% G + C and to contain high levels of cellulose II, associated with the cell envelope (de Winder et al., 1990). A thin sheath may exist. No PE; β-carotene and echinenone are the major carotenoids. There is no N2 fixation under anoxic or oxic conditions. Apparently common in terrestrial sandy areas as surface crusts and is desiccation-resistant. Two other species from field collections have been characterized poorly (see Desikachary, 1959).
Form- Geitlerinema stat. nov.	Filamentous cyanobacteria which form straight to slightly sinuous cylindrical trichomes that divide by binary fission; trichome breakage transcellular. Trichomes less than 5–6 μm in diameter; cells longer than broad or isodiametric, never disc- or coin-like; constrictions between adjacent cells are absent or very shallow; apical cells are rounded, conical or distinctly pointed, tapered, and often bent. Polar gas vesicles rarely present; large cyanophycin granules near crosswalls in some species. Ultrastructural studies of strain PCC 7105 demonstrated a single circular row of pores near the crosswalls (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1982a); whether this holds for the other strains assigned to this genus is unknown. Trichomes of freshly isolated cultures or observed in field material show active gliding motility accompanied by trichome rotation, sometimes leaving behind an extremely thin trail (or almost invisible sheath). Copious amounts of gel-like matter may be produced by some strains, particularly in axenic liquid culture.
Form- Leptolyngbya	Cylindrical trichomes less than 3 μm in diameter; cells isodiametric or longer than wide; constrictions between cells are generally absent or shallow, seldom exceeding 1/8 of the trichome diameter; trichome breakage may be trans- or inter-cellular; apical cells rounded (or exceptionally conical) (Figure 1); persistent sheaths may be produced but are not of firm consistency (and not laminated); in some members, several trichomes may be surrounded by a “mucous-like” matrix. Trichomes nonmotile (or inconspicuously motile as seen by light microscopy, <0.1 μm/s), except for transient motile hormogonia when free of any sheath or coalescent “mucous” material. Some strains or natural specimens may undergo false branching, which may depend mainly on sheath strength.
Form- Limnothrix	The members of this genus, although morphologically similar and apparently phylogenetically closely related to Pseudanabaena spp., deserve separate mention because they are typical constituents of the freshwater plankton (Meffert, 1987). Trichomes composed of elongate cells (although sometimes isodiametric), typically 1–3 µm in diameter (exceptionally up to 6 µm); constrictions between cells indistinct or shallow. Apical cells rounded. Generally synthesis of conspicuous gas vacuoles near both cell poles and in the center of predivisional cells, but sometimes dispersed throughout the cells (Figure 1). Motility lacking or very slight; reproduction by random intercellular trichome breakage. With T.E.M., thylakoids are mainly peripheral.
Form- Lyngbya	Filamentous organisms that share the entire range of cellular types with Oscillatoria (as here defined), but which produce a distinct, persistent, and firm sheath (Figure 1). The sheath may be thin but can be seen with phase contrast optics, particularly where it extends beyond the terminal cell of the trichome (Fig 1). The trichome diameters range from about 6 to ∼80 µm. Sheaths in some species may accrete to several µm in thickness and display laminations. Cells composing the trichomes are disk shaped (shorter than broad), a feature also characteristic of Oscillatoria (as here defined).
Form- Microcoleus	In members assigned to this form-genus, two to several trichomes oriented parallel, often spirally and tightly interwoven, are enclosed by a common homogeneous sheath (Figure 1). Cells (diameter 3–6 µm) composing the trichomes are longer than wide (or isodiametric); visible constrictions at the cross-walls (but usually much less than 1/4 of the cell diameter); mature end cells are conical; the bundles of filaments generally exhibit slow gliding motility, not involving rotation. Based on analysis of a limited number of isolates, a radial arrangement of thylakoids (in cross-section, T.E.M.) seems to be typical.
Form- Oscillatoria	Filamentous organisms that divide exclusively by binary fission and in one plane. The cylindrical trichomes are straight (except for the terminal region in some cases); flexible or semirigid; over ∼4 µm in diameter; disc-like cells wider than long. The trichome diameter of cultured representatives is 4–16 µm, but species with trichomes up to >100 µm in diameter have been described in the botanical literature. Invariably, in larger trichomes (>10 µm in diameter) the cells are much shorter than broad. Cross-walls are generally visible by light microscopy (Figures 1 and 2). Constrictions at cross-walls are lacking or slight, but the total indentation never exceeds 1/8 of the trichome diameter. Generally, the cross-wall is thinner than the longitudinal wall. The initiation of cross-wall synthesis by centripetal growth precedes the completion of previously initiated cross-walls (Figure 3). During fission, the cytoplasmic membrane invaginates, with a thinner peptidoglycan layer following and separating the new membranes of the daughter cells. This characteristic also applies to the genera Spirulina, Arthrospira, and Lyngbya. Reproduction of trichomes is by transcellular breakage involving sacrificial cell death (i.e., “necridial” cells).
Form- Planktothrix	This genus (Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988) corresponds to Cluster 5 of Oscillatoria (sensu Rippka and Herdman, 1992). It is based primarily on the structural and ecological features of O. agardhii and O. rubescens, which are well known planktonic filamentous cyanobacteria with abundant gas vacuoles (Figure 1). Typical of eutrophic or hypereutrophic freshwater lakes or reservoirs, the trichomes of these organisms often form clusters or fascicles and often represent a major constituent of “water blooms”. Like Oscillatoria (sensu stricto) the cells are shorter than broad or isodiametric, and the trichomes exhibit gliding motility by rotation; prominent sheath layers are not produced; the cell diameter of all representatives presently in culture ranges from 3.5 to 10 µm (Skulberg and Skulberg, 1982; Rippka, unpublished). C-PE may be present or absent. Some strains were reported to produce the secondary metabolite 7-methylheptadecane (Jüttner, 1991).
Form- Prochlorothrix	Prochlorothrix is a filamentous organism that divides exclusively by binary fission in one plane and has slight to prominent constrictions at the cross-walls. Cells are longer (3–10 µm) than broad (0.5–1.5 µm in diameter). However, under salt stress (i.e., 25 mM NaCl) cells may enlarge to reach 15 µm in length and 3 µm in width. Thylakoids arranged in layers parallel to the long axis at the periphery of the cytoplasm. Phycobilisomes absent. Motility absent; polar gas vacuoles present; sheaths absent or poorly developed; apical cells undifferentiated (rounded). Lacks N2-fixing ability. Phycobiliproteins (i.e., CPE, C-PC, and APC) absent; chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b present. Zeaxanthin and β-carotene are the major carotenoids.
Form- Pseudanabaena	Trichomes that divide exclusively by binary fission in one plane and have conspicuous constrictions at the crosswalls that may exceed half the cell diameter (Figure 1). In some strains, the total constriction is less but is still more than 1/8 the cell diameter (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1984a). Cells are longer than broad to isodiametric and are often barrel-shaped. Trichomes of strains characterized in culture range from ∼1 to 3 µm in diameter. The formation of the transverse septum involves a partial centripetal ingrowth of all wall layers. In some cases, the remaining connection appears quite narrow, as if the cells were strung as beads. The structural (peptidoglycan) layer of the cross-wall is 3–6 times thicker than the layer surrounding the rest of the cell (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1984a) (Figure 2). Another characteristic observed through T.E.M. is the consistency of peripheral thylakoids, parallel to the cell walls. Near the cross-walls, the continuity of thylakoids may be interrupted by gas vesicle clusters. The trichomes are usually straight and, depending on the morphotype, may be quite short (consisting of less than 3 to ∼10 cells) or may be longer (>10 cells). Reproduction by intercellular trichome breakage. Single detached cells are frequently found in cultured populations and may be confused with unicellular cyanobacteria (Castenholz, unpublished). Gliding motility, probably without rotation, occurs at rates usually <1 µm/s. Gliding motility has been lost in a few cultured strains (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1984a).
Form- Spirulina	Filamentous organisms that divide exclusively by binary fission and in one plane but that grow in the form of a tight to nearly tight, coiled right- or left-handed helix, although this helix may become partly unwound in some trichomes of cultured populations. More loosely coiled representatives often form partial double helices composed of two individual filaments that rotated into each other. The cross-walls are thin and barely visible even if observed by light microscopy using phase contrast objectives, a characteristic that distinguishes this genus from Arthrospira (Holmgren et al., 1971) (Figure 1). Originally Spirulina was described as being a long unicellular thread. No sheath is visible under the light microscope, and “healthy” trichomes are in constant motion. Gliding motility consists of a “turning of the screw”, thus with great transverse movement and little forward motion. Motility is by rotation around the outer surface of the helix. Free ends not in contact with a solid support may oscillate wildly as the coil turns. The terminus of the trichome is either blunt or pointed. In different species the diameter of the trichome can range from <1 µm to ∼5 µm in size. In the latter case, the width of the whole helix may be as great as 12 µm. Color is variable, blue-green to red; the latter being typical of some marine representatives that synthesize C-PE as the major light-harvesting pigment, but contain relatively little PC and APC. Although C-PE content may vary inversely with light intensity, complementary chromatic adaptation has not been observed (Tomaselli et al., 1995). Spirulina isolates seem to be stable with respect to trichome structure. Straight variants, as found often in Arthrospira (Jeeji-Bai and Seshadri, 1980; Lewin, 1980; Rippka, unpublished), have not been observed, even after maintenance in culture for more than 30 years (Rippka, unpublished).
Form- Starria	This nonbranching filamentous cyanobacterium is unique in that the short trichomes are triradiate in cross-section (Lang, 1977). The immotile trichomes are straight to helically twisted. The cells are significantly shorter (length 1–2 µm) than wide (diameter ∼15 µm). The triradiate form usually has broad, arm-like projections 120 degrees apart, separated by U-shaped depressions (Figure 1). The pigmentation is concentrated in the arms. A thin sheath (3 µm thick) covers the trichome. Cross-walls are as found in the genus Oscillatoria, with an invagination of the peptidoglycan layer but not of the outer membrane. The relatively thick peptidoglycan layer of longitudinal walls is characterized by evenly distributed pits 70 nm in diameter, as in some species of Oscillatoria (e.g., O. princeps) (Halfen and Castenholz, 1971; Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1982b). Little is known about the physiology or biochemistry of this organism, but its very unusual structure has been documented by light and electron microscopy (Lang, 1977). This organism is known from a single strain isolated from a terrestrial sample in Zimbabwe. The scarce record of Starria may not imply that it is rare, since cyanobacteria of the soil have not been studied extensively.
Form- Symploca	Trichomes that divide by binary fission in one plane only, with a prominent and persistent sheath (a single trichome per sheath, often with frequent false branching). In contrast to Lyngbya (as treated here), the cells are isodiametric, or slightly longer than broad, and less than 6 µm in width. The constrictions between cells are shallow. The sheathed filaments are arranged in bundles, often forming tufts or turfs in moist terrestrial or intertidal habitats. Geitler (1932) recognized 22 species. This form-genus is very tentative, since many types of ensheathed filamentous cyanobacteria may correspond to this poor definition and some strains of the form-genus Leptolyngbya, and of Lyngbya as defined here, exhibit aerial growth on solid substrates or form pinnacles or tufts under moist culture conditions. However, an approach such as has been taken for the genus Microcoleus, which under the current definition is primarily based on a single morpho- and ecotype (Microcoleus chthonoplastes, see earlier), may be necessary for a more precise concept of Symploca. Strain PCC 8002, although originally described as Microcoleus chthonoplastes (Pearson et al., 1979), does not share the structural features of this species, but rather conforms more to the description of Symploca atlantica Gomont 1892 or Symploca funicularis Setchell and Gardner 1918. The former species has been extensively described by Gomont (1893) on the basis of field collections from intertidal mats in France (where it was found in association with Microcoleus chthonoplastes), whereas the description of S. funicularis, possibly a synonymous species, is based on field material from the coast in California (Setchell and Gardner, 1918). Typically for these two botanical species, the trichomes of strain PCC 8002 are of medium size (5–6 µm in diameter) and are heavily ensheathed. In contrast to Microcoleus chthonoplastes, the terminal cells are not conical but rounded and carry a small “hat-like” flat-pointed to convex calyptra; 1–10 subterminal cells are consistently less pigmented (yellowish), irrespective of the source of nitrogen; on solid media the trichomes exhibit upright aerial growth; although isolated from a marine environment, this strain is euryhaline (Rippka, unpublished). It synthesizes neither PE nor PEC, and MAA (mycosporine-like amino acids) were not detected (Karsten and Garcia-Pichel, 1996). Most importantly, strain PCC 8002 is one of the rare nonheterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria capable of fixing N2 under oxic conditions (Pearson et al., 1979), even if incubated under a continuous light regime (Rippka, unpublished).
Form- Trichodesmium	Filamentous cyanobacteria that divide exclusively by binary fission and in one plane. Trichomes of different species or strains range from 6 to 22 µm in diameter. Cells are isodiametric or slightly longer than broad; constrictions at cross-walls are shallow. Trichomes are arranged in parallel fascicles or form radiate macroscopic clusters; Trichodesmium species often occur as major constituents of the plankton in tropical to semi-tropical oceans; they are reddish to orange in color, containing PE with phycourobilin (PUB) chromophores, exhibiting an absorption peak at ∼493–495 nm (Fujita and Shimura, 1 9 7 4; Glazer, 1 9 8 9). All known members contain abundant gas vacuoles (Figure 1), generally dispersed throughout the cells, and particularly resistant to collapse, even at hydrostatic pressures of 12–27 bars (Walsby, 1 9 9 4).
Form- Tychonema	This genus was created by Anagnostidis and Komárek (1988) and includes filamentous cyanobacteria that resemble in most respects strains typical of Oscillatoria (as defined here). The only characteristics of diagnostic value are thought to be the presence of a sap vacuole (as in eucaryotic algae) and a reticulated network of cytoplasmic strands which contain the thylakoids (Figures 1 and 2). Trichomes of freshwater morphotypes range in diameter from 2 to 16 µm and gas vacuoles are lacking (Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988). However, cultured isolates of the botanical morphotypes Oscillatoria bornetii Zukal 1894 ex Geitler 1932 and O. bornetii f. tenuis Skuja 1930, later assigned to Tychonema (Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988), exhibit a more narrow range in size (diameters 12–16 µm and 4–8 µm, respectively) (Skulberg and Skulberg, 1985). These isolates all contain PE and undergo complementary chromatic adaptation; myxoxanthophyll and oscillaxanthin seem to be the characteristic carotenoids (Skulberg and Skulberg, 1985). Another representative of this “genus” that has been cultured but subsequently lost, is a much larger species (diameter up to 60 µm) that occurs commonly in tychoplankton of protected marine waters of Bermuda (R.W. Castenholz, unpublished; Figure 3).
Subsection IV	NA
Subsection IV.I	NA
Form-Anabaena	Trichomes straight or slightly sinuous, vegetative cells spherical, cylindrical, or barrel shaped, and separated by conspicuous constrictions at the crosswalls. Heterocysts predominantly intercalary, though terminal heterocysts may also occur. Akinetes located, singly or in groups (2–3), adjacent to heterocysts or occurring in chains, initiated distant from heterocysts. A firm sheath is absent, but mucilage production may be abundant. False branching generally not observed. Reproduction by random trichome fragmentation. Hormogonia, distinct in morphology from the parental trichomes, not produced.
Form-Anabaenopsis	Short, immotile trichomes form a loose half circular to a full circular coil composed of 8–16 ellipsoidal, cylindrical, or barrelshaped cells that contain gas vesicle clusters dispersed throughout the vegetative cells. Sheath layers are lacking. Terminal heterocysts often present at both ends of a trichome; new heterocyst differentiate in pairs in the center of the trichome. Akinetes, singly or in pairs, are formed distant from the heterocysts. Structurally distinct hormogonia not produced.
Form-Aphanizomenon	Trichomes are straight and generally exhibit a slight attenuation in size toward their termini; a firm sheath is never produced. Intercalary vegetative cells are cylindrical, significantly longer than wide, and contain abundant gas vesicle clusters. The terminal cells are rounded to subconical and generally lack gas vesicles. Constrictions between individual cells are relatively shallow. Heterocysts differentiate exclusively in intercalary positions. Akinetes, singly or in pairs, are formed adjacent to, or distant from, heterocysts. Structurally distinct hormogonia are not produced.
Form-Cyanospira	Helically coiled, immotile, trichomes with intercalary and terminal heterocysts; the vegetative cells are spherical to ovoid and are separated by relatively deep constrictions; gas vesicle clusters are dispersed throughout the vegetative cells. Defined sheaths are lacking. Asymmetric cell division prior to de novo heterocyst differentiation does not take place. Akinetes differentiate distant from heterocysts, often forming chains. Hormogonia distinct in morphology from mature trichomes not produced.
Form-Cylindrospermopsis	The thin trichomes (<4 µm in diameter) are straight or loosely coiled; vegetative cells are cylindrical and exhibit randomly distributed gas vesicle clusters. Heterocysts occupy exclusively terminal positions, at one or both ends of the trichomes. As the vegetative cells that give rise to them, heterocysts are conical to spear-shaped. Cylindrical akinetes, singly, in pairs or short chains, are formed adjacent to, or slightly distant from, the heterocysts. Sheath layers and hormogonia that differ structurally from the mature filaments are not produced.
Form-Cylindrospermum	Trichomes, generally motile, are untapered and differentiate exclusively terminal heterocysts at one or both ends. The vegetative cells are cylindrical in shape and do not contain gas vesicle clusters. A single large cylindrical to ovoid akinete is formed adjacent to one or both heterocysts in the trichome. Sheath envelopes and structurally distinct hormogonia are not produced.
Form-Nodularia	The trichomes, motile or immotile, are composed of vegetative cells that are shorter than broad (“discoid” or “disk-like”) and may be enclosed in a thin sheath layer. Terminal cells do not differ from intercalary cells. Heterocysts and akinetes are similar in shape to the vegetative cells but often appear compressed. Differentiation of heterocysts takes place predominantly in intercalary positions. Akinetes are initiated usually distant from heterocysts and may occur in short chains. Structurally distinct hormogonia not produced. Planktonic members exhibit gas vesicle clusters dispersed throughout the vegetative cells.
Form-Nostoc	NA
Scytonema	The mature trichomes are immotile, heavily ensheathed, and form numerous false branches that exhibit upright aerial mode of growth. Constrictions between the disk-shaped to cylindrical cells are shallow. Heterocysts generally occupy intercalary positions, although some false branches may carry at their base a terminal heterocyst. Hormogonia are less ensheathed, exhibit no or only slow motility, and differ little in cell morphology from the mature filaments. Akinetes are not produced.
Subsection IV.II	NA
Form-Calothrix	Mature ensheathed trichomes exhibit a pronounced degree of tapering. The motile hormogonia are generally very short, exhibit a significantly reduced cell diameter, and are sheathless (or less ensheathed). They give rise to trichomes that differentiate a basal, one-pored heterocyst. False branching frequent. Akinetes lacking in most members. All are freshwater, soil, or hot spring inhabitants.
Rivularia	NA
Form- Tolypothrix	Mature trichomes exhibit a low degree of tapering, the ratio of the width of basal to apical cells not exceeding 1.5. False branches are frequent, often subtending a “basal” heterocyst. Hormogonia, generally motile and often containing gas vesicle clusters dispersed throughout the cells, give rise to young trichomes that differentiate a single terminal heterocyst. All are freshwater or soil inhabitants. Akinetes are lacking.
Subsection V	NA
Form-Chlorogloeopsis	The filamentous nature of this organism is often unclear, except in the hormogonia. Hormogonia are composed of short chains of cylindrical or barrel-shaped cells which, after ceasing motility, enlarge to become spherical cells (Figure 1). Extracellular sheath is present. Heterocysts develop in both intercalary and terminal positions when levels of combined nitrogen are low. Growth continues, with cell divisions in more than one plane (Figure 1), so that multiseriate trichomes develop. The filamentous nature of the organisms is usually lost, however, since the growing mass of cells commonly fragments into clusters or amorphous aggregates of cells, generally within a mucilaginous sheath (Rippka et al., 1979) (Figure 1). Hormogonia arise from such aggregates. Uneven (asymmetric) divisions of vegetative cells occur; small heterocysts occur when strains are deprived of combined nitrogen (Foulds and Carr, 1981). Masses of vegetative cells may also enlarge to form thicker-walled cells (akinetes or akinete-like cells). Akinete germination takes place with division in several planes and the shedding of extra wall layers (Rippka et al., 1979). Synaptic “pore channels”, common in many other genera in Subsection V, are not present.
Form-Fischerella	The true branches of these organisms are uniseriate and composed of cells, particularly those distal from the base, that are generally longer than broad. The axis (primary trichome) from which they arise is also mainly uniseriate, but may become multiseriate in part, with divisions in more than one plane. The axis in these regions, however, is seldom more than 2–3 cells in thickness. In addition, the cells of the axes become enlarged, often semispherical in shape. The older cells of a main axis may become separated from each other by sheath material and may act as akinetes (Martin and Wyatt, 1974). Most of the widened cells of the axial trichome, however, display a true filamentous nature, with only a peptidoglycan septum separating cells (Nierzwicki et al., 1982; Balkwill et al., 1984). The main axis forms when a hormogonium comes to rest, cells enlarge, and cell divisions that are parallel to the long axis or diagonal (oblique) begin; some of the resulting cells elongate to form branches (secondary trichomes) (Balkwill et al., 1984; Nierzwicki-Bauer et al., 1984) (Figure 1). Extracellular sheaths are absent.
Form-Geitleria	Branching is pseudodichotomous, dichotomous, and lateral (Figure 1). The sheath becomes heavily calcified, and only cells near the tips of trichomes are able to give rise to a lateral branch or, when an apical cell undergoes an oblique division followed by further divisions of both cells, to a false dichotomy (Friedmann, 1955). The ultrastructure of decalcified specimens, including pore channels (i.e. “pit connections”), has been studied by Couté (1982, 1985) (Figure 1). No cultures of this genus have been established.
Form-Iyengariella	Besides true and pseudodichotomous branchings, false branchings are also found; false branches occur after trichome breakage as a result of the formation of a necridium. True dichotomous branches originate from the longitudinal division of the apical cell and pseudodichotomous true branches originate from the oblique division of an intercalary cell. Filaments taper, the trichomes ending in long whips of the rivulariacean type. Heterocysts and akinetes are absent. Reproduction is through hormogonia- formation.
Form-Nostochopsis	The uniseriate trichomes form lateral T-branchings of two types, one long and many celled, the other one of limited growth (1–3 cells) with a heterocyst at the end; besides these pedicellate heterocysts, heterocysts are intercalary or lateral and sessile. A culture of this genus has been established (Weber et al., 1996), but has not been studied taxonomically.
Form-Stigonema	Many species of this genus are extreme examples of multicellular complexity in the cyanobacteria. Main axes with numerous branches may reach thicknesses of 1 mm (Fig. B10.96). Extra-cellular sheaths are present. Pore channels (synapses of microplasmodesmata) occur between all cells derived by division (Fig. B10.93). Branches, although initially simpler than the main axis, eventually become as complex. Tips of branches may be uniseriate for a considerable distance.
Deferribacter	Gram-negative rods. Nonsporulating. Nonmotile. Anaerobic. Fe(III), Mn(IV), and nitrate utilized as electron acceptors. Complex organic extracts and organic acids used as electron donors. No fermentation occurs.
Flexistipes	Flexible rods, nonmotile. No spores formed. Gram negative. Heterotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions. Halophilic, neutrophilic, and slightly thermophilic. Muramic acid and mesodiaminopimelic acid present. Ester lipids in the cytoplasmic membrane. Based on 16S rRNA analyses, Flexistipes clusters with the genera Deferribacter and Geovibrio .
Geovibrio	Vibrioid Gram-negative cells 0.5 × 2–3 µm and motile by a single polar flagellum. Spore formation is not observed. Cells occur singly or in chains. Strictly anaerobic, obligately respiratory chemoorganotroph that oxidizes acetate with Fe(III), S0, or Co(III) as an electron acceptor. Hydrogen, proline, lactate, propionate, Casamino acids, succinate, fumarate, pyruvate, and yeast extract are also used as electron donors for Fe(III) reduction, while other carboxylic acids, sugars, alcohols, amino acids, and aromatic hydrocarbons are not. Optimum temperature, 35°C. Cells contain c-type cytochromes. Grows best in freshwater medium, but will grow in up to 2% NaCl. 16S rRNA sequence analysis shows that Geovibrio currently forms a separate line of descent within the Bacteria .
Deinococcus	Deinococcus strains form either spherical cells 0.5–3.5 µm in diameter, or rods 0.6–1.2 µm wide × 1.5–4.0 µm long. Spherical cells form pairs or tetrads and appear larger than other cocci. Species are mesophilic or thermophilic, with optimum growth temperatures of 25–35°C or 45–50°C, respectively. With the exception of D. grandis, all species stain Gram-positive. Nonmotile, without a differentiated resting stage. Aerobic, catalase is produced. Several distinct cell wall layers are visible by electron microscopy of sections and an outer membrane is included. The peptidoglycan is type A3β and contains l -ornithine. Menaquinone 8 (MK-8) is the predominant respiratory quinone. The phospholipids do not include phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, or derivatives. Fatty acids are saturated or monounsaturated. Unbranched 15, 16, and 17 carbon acids predominate in mesophilic species, branched 16 and 17 carbon acids in thermophilic species. Chemoorganotrophic; metabolism is respiratory. May be proteolytic. All natural isolates are ionizing-radiation resistant. The habitat of the mesophilic species is not defined, thermophilic species are found in hot springs.
Meiothermus	Straight rods, 0.5–0.8 µm in diameter; the cell length is variable. Long filaments are also formed under some culture conditions. Nonmotile; do not possess flagella. Endospores are not observed. Stain Gram-negative. Most strains form red- or orange-pigmented colonies, some strains are bright yellow. Aerobic with a strictly respiratory type of metabolism, but some strains use nitrate as terminal electron acceptor. Oxidase positive; the strains of one species are catalase positive, whereas the strains of the other species are catalase negative. Slightly thermophilic, with optimum growth temperatures of 50–65°C; strains do not grow at 70°C. The optimum pH ranges from 7.5 to 8.0. Menaquinone 8 is the predominant respiratory quinone; ornithine is present in the peptidoglycan. One major phospholipid and two prominent glycolipids migrating close to each other dominate the polar lipid pattern. Additional phospholipids and glycolipids are minor components. Fatty acids are predominantly iso- and anteiso-branched. Branched-chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids are present in all strains. Proteins and peptides are hydrolyzed by all strains. Starch is hydrolyzed by some strains. Hexoses, a few pentoses and a few polyols, disaccharides, amino acids, and organic acids are used as sole carbon and energy sources. Most strains require yeast extract or cofactors for growth. Found in hydrothermal areas with neutral to alkaline pH, also isolated from fermentors.
Thermus	Straight rods, 0.5–0.8 µm in diameter; the cell length is variable. Short filaments are also formed under some culture conditions. Some strains have a stable filamentous morphology. Nonmotile; do not possess flagella. Endospores are not observed. Stain Gram-negative. Most strains form yellow-pigmented colonies, some strains are nonpigmented. Aerobic with a strictly respiratory type of metabolism, but some strains grow anaerobically with nitrate and nitrite as terminal electron acceptors. Oxidase positive and catalase positive. Thermophilic, with an optimum growth temperature of about 70–75°C; most strains have a maximum growth temperature below 80°C, but some strains grow at higher temperatures. The optimum pH is about 7.8. Menaquinone 8 is the predominant respiratory quinone; ornithine is the principal diamino acid of the peptidoglycan. One major phospholipid and one major glycolipid dominate the polar lipid pattern on thin-layer chromatography. Additional phospholipids and glycolipids are minor components. Fatty acids are predominantly iso- and anteiso-branched; branched chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids are present in some strains. Proteins and peptides are hydrolyzed by all strains. Starch is hydrolyzed by some strains. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino acids, and organic acids are used as sole carbon and energy sources. The utilization of pentoses and polyols is very rare. Most strains require yeast extract or cofactors for growth. Found in hydrothermal areas with neutral to alkaline pH, also commonly isolated from man-made thermal environments.
Dictyoglomus	Slender rod to filamentous cells (5–30 × 0.35–0.45 µm), which occur singly or in pairs. Nonsporeforming and nonmotile; no flagella have been observed. Stain Gram-negative, and cell walls possess outer and an inner cell wall layers. Spherical balls of cells, termed rotund bodies, formed due to either cell aggregation or by cell division, are commonly observed. The walls of the cells in the rotund bodies are portioned with the rotund bodies acquiring the outer wall layer with the cells attached to the inner wall layer. Thermophilic, neutrophilic, chemoorganotrophs which are strict anaerobes. Ferment carbohydrates to acetate, lactate, ethanol, CO2, and H2. Occur in natural thermal hot springs and man-made thermal environments (Table 151).
Archaeoglobus	Cells coccoid, regular to highly irregular, 0.4–1.2 µm in width, occurring singly and in pairs. Gram negative. Monopolar polytrichous flagella. Blue-green fluorescence at 420 nm. Growth between 60 and 95°C and pH 5.5–7.5. Strictly anaerobic. Sulfate or sulfite and thiosulfate used as electron acceptors. Chemolithoautotrophic growth in the presence of H2/CO2. Chemoorganotrophic growth on formate, formamide, d(−)- and L(+)-lactate, glucose, starch, Casamino acids, peptone, gelatin, casein, meat extract, yeast extract, and extracts of bacterial and archaeal cells. S0 not used as electron acceptor; inhibits growth. Cell envelope consists of an S-layer composed of subunits in hexagonal array containing a periodate-Schiff-positive polypeptide. Cells contain phytanyl ether lipids. Rifampicin and streptolydigin resistant.
Ferroglobus	Cells irregular coccoid, 0.7–1.3 µm in diameter. Motile by monopolar flagella. Weak blue-green fluorescence at 420 nm. Optimal growth at ~85°C, pH 7.0, and 2% NaCl. Strictly anaerobic. Facultatively chemolithoautotrophic. Growth by oxidation of Fe(II), S2−, and H2; nitrate used as electron acceptor, and, in the presence of H2, also with S2O32− as electron acceptor. S-layer envelope.
Haloarcula	Cells may be rods in liquid culture but are extremely pleomorphic, usually flat, 1–3 µm across with a range of shapes from triangles and squares to irregular disks.

Mostly isolated from soil, or from environments that may have been contaminated directly or indirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinical specimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings, in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species have little or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associated with disease in humans or other animals; an exception is Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other species may cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates.

Pasteuria	Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria. Propagation following germination within a nematode or cladoceran host proceeds through the formation of rounded to elliptical (termed “cauliflower-like” by Metchnikoff, 1888) vegetative microcolonies from which “daughter” microcolonies may be formed. The sporogenous cells at the periphery of the colonies are usually attached by narrow “sacrificial” intercalary hyphae that lyse, resulting in developing sporangia arranged in clumps of eight or more, but more often in quartets, triplets, or doublets and, finally, as single teardrop-shaped or cup-shaped or rhomboidal mature sporangia. The rounded end of the sporangium encloses a single refractile endospore (1.0–3.0 µm in major dimension), an oblate spheroid, ellipsoidal or almost spherical in shape, usually resistant to desiccation and elevated temperatures (one species has somewhat limited heat tolerance). Nonmotile. Sporangia and microcolonies are endoparasitic in the bodies of freshwater, plant, and soil invertebrates.

The cells are Gram-positive, asporogenic, and catalase- and oxidase-negative. No cytochromes. Homofermentative with no CO2 production from glucose. Chemo-organotroph. Facultatively anaerobic. Moderately halophilic. Growth in the presence of 4–18% NaCl, with optimum concentration of 5–10% NaCl; most of the strains will grow at 1% and 25% NaCl. No growth at pH 4.5 and optimum pH is 7.0–8.0. No growth at 10 and 45 °C, optimum temperature of growth is 25–35 °C. Produces l (+)-lactic acid from glucose. Traces of D(−)-lactic acid may be produced and is species-specific. Arginine is not hydrolyzed and nitrate not reduced. Tetragenococcus halophilus requires the growth factors nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, and biotin. Cellular fatty acids are long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and cyclopropane-ring types, predominantly of the ω7 isomer (cis-vaccenic acid) type (Collins et al., 1 990b). Peptidoglycan type is Lys–D-Asp (Satomi et al., 1 997). There are four species in the genus: Tetragenococcus halophilus (type = ATCC 33315T), Tetragenococcus muriaticus (type = JCM 10006T), Tetragenococcus koreensis (type = DSM 16501T; KCTC 3924T), and Tetragenococcus solitarius (type = DSM 5634T).
Vagococcus	Cells are ovoid, occurring singly, in pairs, or chains. Gram-positive. May or may not be motile. Nonsporeforming. Facultatively anaerobic and catalase-negative. Grows at 10 °C but not at 45 °C. Gas is not produced in MRS broth. Acid is produced from D-glucose and some other sugars. Pyrrolidonyl arylamidase and leucine arylamidase are produced. Arginine dihydrolase is not produced. Hippurate is not hydrolyzed. Susceptible to vancomycin.
Lactobacillus	Cells vary from long and slender, sometimes bent rods to short, often coryneform coccobacilli; chain formation common. Motility uncommon; when present, by peritrichous flagella. Nonspore-forming. Gram-stain-positive. Some strains exhibit bipolar bodies, internal granulations, or a barred appearance with the Gram-reaction or methylene blue stain.
Paralactobacillus	Cells straight slender rods. Nonmotile. Do not form spores. Gram-positive. Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic. Grows slowly at 15°C but not at 45°C. Able to grow on acetate agar.

Pediococcus	Nine species are recognized within this genus, including Pediococcus acidilactici (Lindner, 1887; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus claussenii (Dobson et al., 2002), Pediococcus cellicola (Zhang et al., 2005), Pediococcus damnosus (Balcke, 1884; Claussen, 1903; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus dextrinicus (Back, 1978a; Coster and White, 1964; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus inopinatus (Back, 1978a, 1988), Pediococcus parvulus (Günther and White, 1961; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus pentosaceus (Mees, 1934; Skerman et al., 1980) with the subspecies Pediococcus pentosaceus subsp. pentosaceus and Pediococcus pentosaceus subsp. intermedius, and Pediococcus stilesii (Franz et al., 2006). The Pediococcus type species is Pediococcus damnosus (Claussen, 1903). Judicial Opinion 52 states that this generic name is conserved over Pediococcus (Balcke, 1884) and all earlier objective synonyms. Erroneously, the genus name Pediococcus (Balcke, 1884) has been cited in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names (Skerman, McGowan and Sneath, 1980) and in the Amended Edition of the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names (Euzéby, 1998; Skerman, McGowan and Sneath, 1989). These species can clearly be distinguished on the basis of DNA–DNA similarity (Table 88).
Leuconostoc	The genus Leuconostoc comprises 10 species, with three subspecies for Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Leuconostoc paramesenteroides has been reclassified as Weissella paramesenteroides (Collins et al., 1 9 9 3) and Leuconostoc oenos has been assigned to the genus Oenococcus as Oenococcus oeni sp. nov. (Dicks et al., 1 9 9 5a).
Oenococcus	Cells are Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, and asporogenous. Ellipsoidal to spherical in shape, usually arranged in pairs or chains. Cell morphology varies with strain and is influenced by growth medium and age. Chemo-organotrophic, facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative, no cytochromes present. Usually nonproteolytic. Exoprotease activity has been reported for a strain isolated from a red wine produced in Argentina (Manca de Nadra et al., 2005). Nitrate is not reduced. Nonhemolytic. Indole is not formed. Acidophilic (prefers an initial growth pH of 4.8) or non-acidophilic (growth at pH 5.0–7.5; pH 6.0–6.8 as optimum), depending on the species. Growth in media supplemented with 5% (v/v) ethanol is usual, but growth in the presence of 10% (v/v) ethanol depends on the species. Growth in broth is slow and usually uniform. Surface growth is enhanced by incubation in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Colonies usually develop only after 5 d and are less than 1 mm in diameter. Grows between 20 and 30 °C. Requires a rich medium with complex growth factors and amino acids. Tomato juice, grape juice, pantothenic acid, or 4′- O -(β-glucopyranosyl)- d -pantothenic acid may be required for growth and depends on the species. Glucose is fermented to equal amounts of d (−)-lactic acid, CO2, and ethanol or acetate via a pathway not yet fully elucidated. l -malate is decarboxylated to L (+)-lactate in the presence of a fermentable carbohydrate. Polysaccharides and most alcohols are not metabolized. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-P-DH) not present. Habitat: wine, cider and distilled shochu residue.
Weissella	The description for the genus is as published by Collins et al. (1993). The cells are either short rods with rounded tapered ends (see Figure 120 for Weissella cibaria) or ovoid and occur in pairs or in short chains. A tendency toward pleomorphism may be found for strains in species such as Weissella minor (see Figure 121). Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, and asporogenous. Chemo-organotrophic, facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative, and devoid of cytochromes. Obligately fermentative chemo-organotrophs; ferment glucose heterofermentatively and have complex nutritional requirements. The genus Weissella belongs to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) because of their metabolism and phylogenetic position. Carbohydrate fermentation via the hexose-monophosphate and the phosphoketolase pathways. End products of glucose fermentation are CO2, ethanol, and/or acetate. The configuration of lactic acid is either DL- or D(−), depending on the species. Amino acids, peptides, fermentable carbohydrates, fatty acids, nucleic acids, and vitamins are generally required for growth. Biotin, nicotine, thiamine, and pantothenic acid or its derivatives are required by all strains. Arginine is not hydrolyzed by all species. Growth occurs at 15 °C, with some species growing at 42–45 °C. Cell-wall peptidoglycan is based on lysine as diamino acid, and, with the exception of Weissella kandleri, all contain alanine or alanine and serine in the interpeptide bridge. In addition, the interpeptide bridge of Weissella kandleri (Lys–L-Ala–Gly–L-Ala2) contains glycine (Holzapfel and van Wyk, 1 9 8 2). The phenotypic characteristics of Weissella spp. are listed in Table 128.
Lactococcus	Spheres or ovoid cells occur singly, in pairs, or in chains, and are often elongated in the direction of the chain. Gram-stain-positive. Endospores are not formed. Nonmotile. Not β-hemolytic. Facultatively anaerobic; catalase-negative. Growth at 10°C but not at 45°C. Usually grows in 4% (w/v) NaCl with the exception of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris which only tolerates 2% (w/v) NaCl. Chemo-organotroph. Metabolism fermentative. The predominant end product of glucose fermentation is L(+)-lactic acid. May contain menaquinones. Most strains react with group N antisera (Lancefield, 1 9 3 3). Nutritional requirements are complex and variable. The peptidoglycan is of group A with L-lysine as diamino acid in position 3 of the peptide subunit. Typical inhabitants of plants, animals, and their products.
Lactovum	Gram-stain-positive, mesophilic, anaerobic with an aerotolerant, chemo-organotrophic, fermentative metabolism. Cells are ovoid, do not form spores, and lack flagella (Figure 126).
Streptococcus	Streptococcus strains are normally spherical or ovoid, less than 2 µm in diameter, occurring in chains or in pairs when grown in liquid media. Cells are nonmotile. Endospores are not formed. Gram-positive. Virtually all species are facultatively anaerobic, some requiring additional CO2 for growth. Chemo-organotrophic with fermentative metabolism. Carbohydrates are fermented to produce mainly lactic acid but no gas. Catalase-negative. Nutritional requirements are complex and variable. The peptidoglycan is of group A (Schleifer and Kandler, 1972) with L-lysine as the diamino acid in position 3 of the peptide subunit. Menaquinones are not present. Cell-wall polysaccharides form the basis of the Lancefield serological grouping scheme (Lancefield, 1933). Rhamnose is a common constituent of almost all streptococcal cell walls and its notable absence among members of the Mitis species group which includes Streptococcus pneumoniae, together with the presence of significant amounts of ribitol, are valuable chemotaxonomic markers for these taxa.
Alkaliphilus	Straight to slightly curved rods, 0.4–0.7 × 2.0–6.0 µm. Gram-stain-positive and endosporeforming. The cells exhibit motility with flagella. Slightly halophilic and mesophilic with optimum growth at 35–40 °C. Strictly anaerobic, and neutrophilic to alkaliphilic heterotrophs. Proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract, peptone, and tryptone are utilized as energy and carbon sources. Fermentation and/or respiration of organic substrates in the presence and/or absence of the electron acceptors such as S0, thiosulfate, fumarate, crotonate, Fe(III), Co(III), or Cr (VI) supports growth. Predominant cellular fatty acids are variable among the species but C14:0, C14:1, C15:0 iso, C16:0, C16:1 ω7c are major components. Cell walls contain m-diaminopimelic acid, glycine, aspartate, glutamate, and ribose.

Ferments proteinaceous substrates and carbohydrates. Member of the family Clostridiaceae based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons (Figure 1).
Clostridium	Rods, usually stain Gram-positive at least in very early stages of growth, although in some species Gram-stain-positive cells have not been seen. Motile or nonmotile. When motile, cells usually are peritrichous. The majority of species form oval or spherical endospores that usually distend the cell.

From an ultrastructural standpoint, cells of heliobacteria lack intracytoplasmic membranes or chlorosomes, and thus electron micrographs of the cytoplasm give no indication that the cells are phototrophic (Figure 4). Colonies on a yeast extract/salts medium (medium PYE, see Kimble et al., 1995) frequently have irregular margins because of wavy protrusions of cell masses in palisade formations, similar to what is seen in gliding bacteria. Motility variable but usually by polar or subpolar flagella; H. chlorum may show slow gliding movement. Some species, particularly H. chlorum, lyse readily at stationary phase in rich or defined media. One species is thermophilic.

Butyrivibrio	Gram-stain-negative, but structurally Gram-positive, non-sporeforming, strictly anaerobic straight to curved rods, 0.3–0.8 × 1.0–5.0 µm, occurring singly or in chains or filaments that may be helical. Motile by monotrichous or lophotrichous, polar or subpolar flagella or nonmotile. Chemo-organotrophic, fermentative metabolism with carbohydrates as the main substrates. Glucose or maltose are fermented with butyrate as a major end product. Under some conditions some strains may produce large amounts of lactate and little butyrate. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, Butyrivibrio belongs to cluster XIVa of the Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive bacteria. It is not monophyletic: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains form two distinct subgroups which correspond to different genera and Butyrivibrio crossotus occupies a separate position (Willems et al., 1996). Butyrivibrio hungatei belongs to the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens subgroup that also comprises the type strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (Kopečný et al., 2003). According to the 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis presented in the roadmap to this volume (Figure 1), the genus Butyrivibrio is a member of the family Lachnospiraceae, order Clostridiales, class Clostridia in the phylum Firmicutes. Isolated from the rumen of ruminants and in human, rabbit, and horse feces.
Catonella	Obligately anaerobic, catalase-negative, Gram-stain-negative, non-spore-forming rods. Nonmotile. End products of carbohydrate fermentation include major amounts of acetate and smaller amounts of formate and lactate. Major cellular fatty acids when grown in peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth include C 14:0 fatty acid, C 14:0 dimethyl acetal, and C 16:0 fatty acid. Catonella is associated with periodontitis in human gingival crevices and periodontal pockets. The mol% G+C content of DNA is 34. Based on 16S rDNA sequence of its type strain, Catonella belongs to cluster XIVa (Collins et al., 1994) of the Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive bacteria.
Coprococcus	Cocci that are Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, and obligately anaerobic chemoorganotrophs. All species in the genus are isolated from human feces (Moore and Holdeman, 1974) but rarely isolated from human clinical specimens. Strains were originally isolated on an anaerobically sterilized rumen-fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (Holdeman et al., 1977a) roll tube. However, pure cultured strains grow on anaerobically incubated blood agar plates (supplemented with brain heart infusion agar with 5% sheep blood). Cells may occur as pairs or chains of pairs. Cells of the some species are slightly elongated, in particular, when grown in medium containing fermentable carbohydrates. Fermentable carbohydrates are either required or are highly stimulatory for growth. Major fermentation products include butyric and acetic acids, with formic or propionic acid. Characteristics to differentiate species of the genus Coprococcus and biochemically closely related species of the Ruminococcus are given in Table 167. The genus phylogenetically belongs to family Lachnospiraceae and the phylogenetic position within the family is shown in Figure 1 (Ezaki et al., 1994; Rainey and Janssen, 1995; Willems and Collins, 1995a). In the family Lachnospiraceae, members of genus Coprococcus are phylogenetically closely related to anaerobic curved bacteria, genus Lachnospira as in Figure 1.

In peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth a moderate amount of acetate and isovalerate, and traces of lactate, succinate, isobutyrate and butyrate are produced. Major cellular fatty acids when grown in peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth include an unidentified compound with an equivalent chain-length of 9.740, C 14:0 and C16:0 fatty acids. Johnsonella is associated with gingivitis and periodontitis in human gingival crevice and periodontal pockets.

In co-culture, cells produce acetate and H2 from butyrate and longer straight-chain, even-numbered-carbon fatty acids and acetate, propionate, and H2 from n-valerate and longer straight-chain, odd-numbered-carbon fatty acids. At least some strains produce acetate, isovalerate, and H2 from iso acids such as isoheptanoate and some strains produce acetate, propionate, and H2 from 2-methylbutyrate. It is possible, but has not yet been determined, that anteiso acids such as anteisooctanoate are degraded to acetate, anteisohexanoate, and H2. The strains studied so far can, with considerable difficulty, be adapted to grow slowly in axenic culture on crotonate, with acetate and butyrate as the products. Carbohydrates, proteinaceous materials, alcohols, and other organic compounds do not support growth. Common electron acceptors such as fumarate, malate, nitrate, oxygen, sulfate, sulfite, sulfur, and thiosulfate are not utilized with butyrate as the electron donor.

The temperature range for growth of co-cultures with Methanospirillum hungatei is in the broad mesophilic range, with an optimum of 30–37°C.

Thermoanaerobacter	All species are obligately anaerobic thermophiles and have a Gram-positive cell wall, i.e., although the Gram-stain reaction varies among the individual species and even within strains from the same species, they have a Gram-positive cell-wall structure. Most species exhibit a sluggish motility and a peritrichous arrangement of 2–6 flagella (retarded peritrichous flagellation). Cells are rod shaped and occur in various arrangements that vary by species. Many of the Thermoanaerobacter species form pleomorphic cells during the late exponential and stationary growth phases assembling through nonsymmetric cell division chains of alternating rod-shaped and coccoid cells. Other types of pleomorphic rods are formed, presumably through weakening of the cell wall by lysozyme-like enzymes that are the remnants of the sporulation process (Figure 1). Growth temperature optima range from 55–75 °C, with growth ranges of 35–78 °C and a temperature span over 35 °C. The pH for growth ranges from pH25C 4.0–9.9, with a pH optimum of 5.8–8.5. Several species also exhibit a wide pH optimum of about 3 units without a sharp peak. All species are able to grow organoheterotrophically using various fermentation pathways including the homoacetogenic or Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, or using inorganic electron acceptors (e.g., Thermoanaerobacter sulfuriphilus using S0 as an electron acceptor and lactate as an electron donor and carbon source). Some Thermoanaerobacter strains are also able to grow chemolithoheterotrophically by coupling H2 oxidation to growth (Fardeau et al., 1994). Furthermore, others are facultative chemolithoautotrophs, growing with H2 + CO2 (such as Thermoanaerobacter kivui) or Fe(III) + H2 + CO2 (such as Thermoanaerobacter siderophilus). Generally, typical fermentation products from hexoses are ethanol, acetate, lactate, H2, and CO2.

Acetate, ethanol, H2 and bicarbonate are the main fermentation products from glucose.
Candidatus Magnetobacterium	Rod-shaped, large, magnetic cells occurring in freshwater sediments. The original description is based on bacteria enriched from the littoral sediment of a freshwater lake in Southern Germany (Chiemsee); similar types of bacteria were also observed in sediments of other freshwater lakes and ponds in Southern Germany and Brazil. Counts of active bacteria in different vertical layers of Chiemsee sediment indicated that “Candidatus M. bavaricum” is a typical gradient organism, particularly adapted to zones characterized by low levels of oxygen, where it reaches the highest abundance (Spring et al., 1993). A minor fraction of these bacteria was also found in the anoxic zone, whereas high concentrations of oxygen can apparently not be tolerated by this bacterium over longer periods of time.
Leptospirillum	Small, Gram-negative, vibrioid or spiral-shaped cells (0.9–2.0 × 0.2–0.5 µm). Motile by means of a single (in most cases) polar flagellum. No known resting stages. Obligately chemolithotrophic, using the oxidation of ferrous iron (or ferrous iron-containing sulfide minerals, such as pyrite) as sole energy source, and fixing carbon dioxide by the Benson-Calvin cycle. Obligately aerobic and acidophilic; pH optima for growth is generally 1.3–2.0. Mesophilic isolates and a single moderately thermophilic isolate have been described. Leptospirillum forms a distinct lineage within the proposed Nitrospira phylum (Ehrich et al., 1995). Widely distributed in natural and industrial environments where the accelerated oxidation of sulfide ores creates acidic, metal-rich ecosystems.
Nitrospira	Vibrio-like to spiral-shaped rods, 0.2–0.4 × 0.9–2.2 μm. Cells reproduce by binary fission. Intracytoplasmic membranes are lacking. Gram negative. Usually nonmotile. Aerobic. The major source of energy and reducing power is from the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. Lithoautotrophs, but cells can also grow mixotrophically. Cells were isolated from ocean environments and heating systems. Also occurs in soil samples, freshwater, and activated sludge.
Thermodesulfovibrio	Curved or vibrioid rod-shaped single cells or in chains, 0.3 × 1.7 μm, spore formation not observed. Gram negative. Motile by means of single polar flagellum. Strict anaerobe.

Gemmata	Spherical to pear-shaped cells, 1.4–3.0 × 1.4–3.0 µm. Gram-stain-negative. Cells reproduce by budding, with the single daughter cell a mirror image of the mother cell, and there may be a narrow bud attachment site. Cells can bud repeatedly. Cells possess a multitrichous bundle of flagella. Aerobic, having a strictly aerobic type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Colonies have pink pigmentation.
Isosphaera	Planctomycetes / Planctomycetia / Planctomycetales / Planctomycetaceae / Isosphaera
Pirellula	Pear or teardrop-shaped cells with one pointed attachment pole, 0.5–3.0 × 1.0–5.0 µm. Gram-stain-negative. Cells do not possess a stalk, but may form a fibrillar holdfast. Frequently form rosettes by attachment with the pointed cell pole. The holdfast occurs on one pole of the cell (the narrow pole of ovoid cells) and facilitates attachment to other cells to form rosettes. Crateriform structures are distributed at one pole only. Reproduction is solely by bud formation. Buds are formed at or near the opposite, wider pole which thus constitutes the reproductive pole. Newly formed buds are motile by polar to subpolar monotrichous flagella. When thin sectioned cells prepared via cryosubstitution are examined via electron microscopy, they display a characteristic organization including a major cell compartment, the pirellulosome, in which ribosomes and a condensed nucleoid are enclosed by an intracytoplasmic membrane, and a ribosome-free paryphoplasm region between this intracytoplasmic membrane and the closely apposed cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. Chemoorganotrophic; obligately aerobic. The original description was emended following the description of Rhodopirellula and Blastopirellula to include more recent data (Schlesner et al., 2004). The major polyamine is symhomospermidine. The major respiratory lipoquinone present is MK-6. The major phospholipid present is phosphatidylglycerol. A number of other lipids are present that have characteristic R f values, but whose structures are not currently known. The lipid pattern is characteristic.

Planctomyces	Cells are spherical, ovoid, ellipsoidal, teardrop-shaped, or bulbiform. Often relatively large (ignoring appendages and aggregations, individual vegetative cells range up to 3.5 µm in greatest dimension; immature buds smaller). Have at least one major multifibrillar (nonprosthecate) appendage (called a spike, spire, fascicle, bristle, or stalk) which does not always have the true stalk function of connecting the cell to a substratum. Divide by budding. A holdfast-which is not always an easily visualized, discrete structure-is often present at the distal end of an appendage or at one end of the cell. Often form homologous aggregations, rosettes or bouquets, by attachment at the holdfasts in natural habitats. Produce crateriform surface structures (surface pits 12 nm in diameter, circumscribed by a grommet with a 30–36 nm outside diameter) and pili in characteristic patterns. Gram-stain-negative bacteria. Lack peptidoglycan. Resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. Divide by budding. Some species have a dimorphic life cycle: a sessile mother cell buds; the bud develops into a swarmer that is motile by means of a flagellum (often ensheathed); after maturation, the swarmer loses its flagellum and becomes a sessile, budding mother cell. All cultivated species are aerobes or facultative anaerobes. Occur worldwide in both eutrophic and oligotrophic freshwaters, as well as in estuarine and marine habitats. Sometimes become encrusted with iron and manganese oxides. Often associated in nature with algae and cyanobacteria. Although several species have now been isolated in pure culture, the type species and various other rosette-forming species have not been cultivated axenically. Carbohydrates are reported to be the main carbon source for cultivated members of the genus, which are relatively slow-growing.

Asticcacaulis	Cells single, unbranched, rod-shaped, poles blunt or gently rounded; 0.5–0.7 × 1–3 µm during growth in most media. Some cells in any growing population have one subpolar or one or two lateral prosthecae. Each prostheca includes outer membrane, peptidoglycan, cell membrane, and a core sometimes observed to be occupied in part by membranes, but other cytoplasmic components cannot be discerned through most of its length. Beyond the cell–prostheca juncture, prostheca diameter is constant, 0.10–0.15 µm; each prostheca possesses at least one stalk band as a substructure after the cell has matured and completed at least one cell cycle. Other cells in the same population bear a single, subpolar flagellum. Each type of cell bears a small mass of adhesive material, the holdfast, at one pole; the holdfast site is not coincident with the site of the flagellum or of the prostheca(e). Binary fission occurs by septation, typically resulting in the production of a longer, prosthecate cell and a shorter, flagellated cell. Fission may occur in cells lacking prosthecae. In both instances, cell division is unequal.
Brevundimonas	Gram-negative, rod-shaped, subvibrioid or vibrioid cells, 0.4–0.5 × 1–2 µm. Cells of some species can form prosthecae (stalks). These species are characterized by an asymmetric cell division whereby fission results in a prosthecate (nonmotile) and a flagellated (motile) cell. Motility by means of single polar flagella. Nonsporeforming. A yellow or orange carotenoid pigment may be formed.
Caulobacter	Cells single, unbranched, with tapered poles; long axis typically distinctly curved, conferring a vibrioid shape, but may be straight in some isolates and the cell shape fusiform; 0.4–0.6 × 1–2 µm during growth in most media. The younger pole of the dividing cell bears a single flagellum, and the older pole bears a prostheca (the stalk) developed by outgrowth of the cell envelope. The stalk includes outer membrane, peptidoglycan, cell membrane, and a core sometimes observed to be occupied in part by membranes but not in any case by any other discernible cytoplasmic components. Stalk diameter is constant along its length, varying from 0.11 to 0.18 µm among isolates; the stalk possesses at least one stalk band as a substructure after the cell has matured and completed at least one cell cycle. Binary fission is constrictive and is completed without formation of a septum. The stalk-bearing progeny cell grows and eventually repeats the asymmetric cell division. The flagellum-bearing progeny cell, after a period of motility, releases the flagellum and develops its stalk at the previously flagellated site as it grows and proceeds to its asymmetric cell division. At the base of the flagellum and at the outer tip of the stalk is a small mass of adhesive material, the holdfast, which confers adhesiveness on each of the progeny.
Phenylobacterium	Rods, coccobacilli, or cocci; 0.7–1.0 × 1.0–2.0 μm occurring singly, in pairs, or in short chains. Some strains tend to clump.

Faintly stains Gram negative (stains poorly or not at all with many aniline dyes) but satisfactorily with Romanowsky's or Giemsa's stain. Warthin-Starry silver staining of fixed tissue sections reveals bacilli in clusters. May be seen in stained blood films appearing as rounded or ellipsoidal forms or as slender, straight, curved, or bent rods, occurring singly or in groups. They characteristically occur in chains of seve ral segmenting organisms, sometimes swollen at one or both ends and frequently beaded. In the tissues, they are situated within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells as isolated elements or are grouped in rounded masses. Intraerythrocytic forms occur in the blood of felines, small rodents, birds, fish, and other animals. In cultures, the cells may be very autoadherent. Some species possess unipolar flagella. The presence of pili is associated with the marked adherence and may mediate specific interaction with host endothelial cells and erythrocytes leading to intracellular localization.

There is usually no requirement for vitamins with the rare exception of biotin, which also may be inhibitory to some strains. 3-Ketoglycosides are not produced (Bernaerts and De Ley, 1963). The organisms are characteristically able to enter the root hairs of tropical-zone and some temperate-zone leguminous plants (family Leguminosae) and incite the production of root nodules, in which the bacteria occur as intracellular nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some strains, especially B. elkanii, fix nitrogen in the free-living state when examined under special conditions.

At least one hypha originates laterally; others may appear at the cell poles. Multiplication is by budding at the hyphal tips, with the long axis of the bud arranged perpendicular to the hyphal axis (Figures 1 and 2). Mature buds either separate from the hyphae as uniflagellated swarmers or remain attached. Extracellular polymers can be stained with ruthenium red and sometimes are visible in India ink mounts as thick capsules around mother cells. Oxidized iron or manganese compounds are deposited on mother cells and later on hyphae. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative, older cells variable.

Inorganic nitrogen compounds allow only poor growth of some isolates; nitrate is reduced by most strains. Slow and poor growth occurs on agar media with 0.1–1% fulvic acid iron sesquioxide complexes as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Vitamin mixtures stimulate growth; lack of vitamins results in pleomorphic cells, which produce large granules of poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Growth is inhibited by polymyxin B and neomycin.
Prosthecomicrobium	Unicellular bacterium with coccobacillary to rod-shaped cells ranging in diameter from 0.8 to 1.2 µm and containing numerous prosthecae extending from all locations on the cell surface.

Buds are produced directly from the mother cell, never from tips of prosthecae. Gram negative. Motile and nonmotile species exist. Motile organisms produce single polar to subpolar flagella; one species forms gas vacuoles but not flagella. Obligately aerobic, nonfermentative, heterotrophic. A variety of sugars and organic acids are used as energy sources for growth. All strains tested require one or more B vitamins for growth. Oxidase and catalase positive. Found in soils and fresh and marine waters.

Seliberia	Rods, 0.5–0.8 µm in diameter and 1–12 µm in length, with a helically sculptured or furrowed topography. The ends of the cell may be either blunt or rounded. Stellate aggregates (rosettes) of sessile rods joined at one pole, and individual, shorter motile rods (swarmers) occur in the same culture. An adhesive holdfast, secreted at one pole, mediates attachment into rosettes. Growth on appropriate soil extract media may permit formation of round to ovoid “generative cells”. Capsules are not produced, although a thin glycocalyx is produced later in the growth cycle. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative. Following unidirectional polar cell growth, a shorter motile cell (a swarmer) and a longer sessile cell are produced by asymmetric transverse fission. A single subpolar ensheathed flagellum is characteristically present on the swarmer; several lateral flagella, not ensheathed, may also be present. Strictly aerobic. Optimal temperature, 25–30°C; maximum ca. 37°C, minimum 15–20°C. Chemoorganotrophic, having an oxidative type of metabolism. Catalase and oxidase positive. These organisms live in soil and fresh water environments as autochthonous microflora, often where oligotrophic conditions prevail.
Starkeya	Short rods, coccoidal or ellipsoidal cells 0.4–0.8 × 0.8–2.0 µm, occurring singly and, occasionally, in pairs. Nonmotile. Colonies grown on thiosulfate agar (with biotin) are small, smooth, circular, round, and opalescent, becoming white with sulfur. Thiosulfate liquid medium (lacking biotin) becomes turbid and sulfur precipitates during static incubation; thiosulfate is incompletely used, and the pH falls from 7.8 to 5.8. This poor development is due to the requirement for biotin exhibited by the type strain. The organism is facultatively chemolithoautotrophic, but optimal autotrophic development requires biotin, and optimal heterotrophic growth requires yeast extract, biotin, or other additions, such as pantothenate, depending on the organic substrate. Autotrophic growth is also observed with formate when high levels of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase are expressed. Some strains may degrade methylated sulfides. This organism is strictly aerobic, both autotrophically and heterotrophically, and is incapable of denitrification. Oxidizes and grows on thiosulfate and tetrathionate but not on sulfur or thiocyanate. Ammonium salts, nitrates, urea, and glutamate are used as nitrogen sources. Optimal temperature 25–30°C; growth range 10–37°C (no growth at 5°C or 42°C). Optimal pH 7.0; growth range pH 5.7–9.0. Contains ubiquinone Q-10. Major cellular fatty acids are octadecenoic acid and cyclopropane acid of C19; lacks a major hydroxy fatty acid.

Pleomorphic cells are produced on media containing tricarboxylic cycle-intermediates (especially succinate), whereas coccoid cells as well as cells up to 10 µm long are produced on media containing an alcohol as the sole carbon source. Refractile (polyphosphate) and lipid (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate) bodies are evenly distributed in the cells. Resting stages are unknown. Key sporulation genes are absent. Depending on the species and growth conditions, the cells are nonmotile or motile (by peritrichous flagella). The Gram reaction frequently appears falsely to be positive or variable due to polyphosphate granules; however, ultrastructurally and biochemically, the cell wall is of the negative Gram-type.1Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Optimal temperature, 25–30°C. Optimal pH, 5.8–9.0. Colonies are opaque and slimy (although “slimeless” strains exist) and are yellow due to a water-insoluble carotenoid pigment (zeaxanthin dirhamnoside). The color intensity depends on the amount of slime produced by individual strains. Catalase positive. All strains can grow chemolithoautotrophically in mineral media under an atmosphere of H2, O2, and CO2 (7:2:1, v/v) as well as chemoorganoheterotrophically on methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and various organic acids as sole carbon sources. The carbohydrate utilization spectrum is limited, and neither volatile/ nonvolatile fatty acids nor gas is produced from carbohydrates such as fructose, glucose, or mannose. Some strains require vitamins. Some strains can utilize substituted thiophenes as sole carbon, energy, and sulfur sources. When degrading aliphatic epoxides, tested strains contain coenzyme M, which otherwise is a typical coenzyme of the obligate anaerobic methanogenic archaea. N2 is fixed in nitrogen-deficient media under heterotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic growth conditions, but by most strains only under a decreased O2 pressure. The bacteria occur free-living in freshwater (mainly X. agilis), wet soil containing decaying organic material (X. autotrophicus, X. flavus), marine sediments (X. flavus), compost of root balls of Tagetes (thiophenutilizing X. tagetidis), and associated with the roots of plants including wetland rice (X. flavus). Xanthobacter can be regarded an associative N2-fixing bacterium (rice, tagetis, coconut palm). The induction of root or stem nodules has not been observed. 16S rDNA sequence analysis places the members into the class Alphaproteobacteria; however, the presently recognized species of Xanthobacter are intermixed with the single-species genera Aquabacter and Azorhizobium, and together they form a distinct cluster.

Peptone is poorly utilized. Casein, starch, chitin, and agar are not hydrolyzed. All known Rhizobium species include strains which induce hypertrophisms in plants as root nodules with or without symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Some cells of symbiotic bacterial species enter root hair cells of leguminous plants (Family Leguminosae) via invagination or by wounds (“crack entry”) and elicit the production of root nodules wherein the bacteria engage as intracellular symbionts, usually fixing nitrogen. Many well-defined nodulation (nod) and nitrogen fixation (nif) genes are clustered on large plasmids or megaplasmids (pSyms). Plasmid transfer between species results in the expression and stable inheritance of the particular plant-interactive properties of the plasmid-donor species. Plant host specificity is usually for a few legume genera but may, in some strains, include a wide variety of legume genera and is to some extent determined by the chemical structure of the lipochito-oligosaccharide Nod factors produced. These chitin-like molecules induce nodule organogenesis in the absence of bacteria. In root nodules the bacteria occur as endophytes that exhibit pleomorphic forms, termed “bacteroids”, which reduce or fix gaseous atmospheric nitrogen into a combined form utilizable by the host plant.

All strains require pantothenate and nicotinic acid. Peptone is poorly utilized. Casein and agar are not hydrolyzed. Oxidase positive. Catalase positive. 3-Ketolactose not produced from lactose. The organisms are characteristically able to invade the root hairs of temperatezone and tropical-zone leguminous plants (family Leguminoseae) and incite production of root nodules wherein the bacteria occur as intracellular nitrogen-fixing microsymbionts.

Skermanella	Gram negative, with unicellular and multicellular growth phases. Does not form spores. Unicellular phase cells are rod shaped, with rounded or tapered ends and a straight or curved axis. Motile with single polar flagellum and one or more lateral flagella of different wavelengths. Multicellular phase conglomerates arise from cells that lose motility, become optically refractile, and reproduce by multiplanar septation. No filamentous structures or buds are formed. Obligately chemoorganotrophic and facultatively anaerobic, having fermentative metabolism. Belongs to the Alphaproteobacteria.
Incertae Sedis XII. “Sporospirillum”	Rigid, helical bacteria of enormous size, 1.8–4.8 μm in diameter and 40–100 μm in length. Structures that morphologically resemble endospores occur within the cells, but their thermal resistance has not been determined. The spore-like structures have the ability to rotate and to migrate within the cytoplasm of the bacteria. They initially develop near the cell poles and subsequently migrate to the center where they are released after the cell ruptures and disintegrates. The Gram reaction has not been reported. The cells are motile, but no organs of locomotion are evident. The relationship of the cells to oxygen is unknown. Occur in the intestinal contents of tadpoles. Have not been isolated. A type strain has not been designated.
Anaplasma	Small, often pleomorphic, coccoid to ellipsoidal cells 0.3–0.4 μm in diameter found in cytoplasmic vacuoles in mammalian host cells, often in inclusion bodies (morulae) in mature or immature hematopoietic cells, in peripheral blood, or in tissues, usually organs containing mononuclear phagocytes (spleen, liver, bone marrow) of mammalian hosts. Morulae are suspended in a non-fibrillar matrix. Two morphologic forms: larger reticulate cells and smaller “dense core” forms. In blood smears stained by Romanowsky methods, the organisms appear as dense, homogeneous, bluish-purple, round inclusions 0.3–2.5 µm in diameter. Gram negative. Nonmotile. No spores or resistant stages. Ticks are the only known biological vectors; mechanical vectors include biting flies or other fomites. The organisms can be propagated in tick spp. Some anaplasmas can be propagated in tick cell lines or mammalian cells of hematopoietic origin. Cause disease in canids, humans, and ruminants. Variably pathogenic in cattle, goats, sheep, deer, horses, and rodents. Placed in the Alphaproteobacteria by 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis; organisms possess not less than 96% 16S rRNA gene similarity. Where studied, these bacteria possess major surface protein genes with a high degree of sequence similarity nontandemly dispersed throughout the chromosome.
Ehrlichia	Coccoid to ellipsoidal cells. Found in cytoplasmic vacuoles in endothelial or hemopoietic mammalian host cells, including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and cells of the bone marrow, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Often occur in clusters (morulae). Pleomorphic; occur as reticulate cells and “dense core forms” with condensed cytoplasm (Popov et al., 1998). Gram negative. Nonmotile. Some species grow in cultured tick cells or in cultured mammalian monocytes, macrophages, or endothelial cells. Cause disease in ruminants, canids, rodents, and humans. Ticks are the primary vectors and hosts. Belong to the Alphaproteobacteria by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis; the organisms exhibit ≥97.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with one another. Where studied, these bacteria possess surface protein antigen genes that are tandemly arranged in the chromosome and have a high degree of sequence similarity (Ohashi et al., 1998a, b; Reddy et al., 1998; McBride et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2000a).
Neorickettsia	Coccoid or pleomorphic cells that reside in cytoplasmic vacuoles within monocytes and macrophages of dogs, horses, bats, and humans. Small (0.2–0.4 µm) electron dense forms and relatively large (0.8–1.5 µm) lighter forms may occur. Tissues of adult trematode (fluke) vectors and all other fluke stages—eggs, miracidia, rediae, sporocysts, cercariae, and metacercariae—produce infection when injected into susceptible hosts, indicating transovarial transmission in the vector. Transstadial transmission also occurs. Gram negative. Nonmotile. Most species are cultivable in peripheral blood monocytes, myelomonocytic cell lines, or promyelocytic cell lines. Some species are pathogenic to laboratory mice. Etiologic agents of diseases of dogs and other canids, horses, and humans. Where studied, these bacteria possess an antigenically cross-reactive group-specific protein gene with a high degree of sequence identity. Sensitive to tetracycline antibiotics. The estimated genome size is 860–900 kb.
Wolbachia	Pleomorphic bacteria that appear as small rods (0.5–1.3 µm in length) and coccoid forms (0.25–1 µm); large forms (1–1.8 µm in diameter) may be observed. Grow in vacuoles of host cells. Do not grow outside of cells. Associated with arthropods and filarial nematodes. Responsible for reproductive alterations in arthropods. With few exceptions, not pathogenic for the host. Strains associated with nematodes responsible for indirect pathogenesis in humans. Susceptibility to doxycycline and rifampin demonstrated in vitro and in vivo .
Incertae Sedis V. Aegyptianella	In blood smears stained by Romanowsky methods, the inclusions appear in erythrocytes as purple intracytoplasmic bodies of 0.3–4 µm in size. By electron microscopy, each inclusion contains between 1 and 26 pleomorphic cocci with trilaminar outer membranes. They are obligate parasites of domestic and wild birds. Transmitted by ticks.
Holospora	The description of the genus is that of the family. Diagnostic characteristics are given in Table 1.
Incertae Sedis II Caedibacter	Straight rods or coccobacilli 0.4–1.0 × 1.0–4.0 µm. Gram negative, nonflagellated, nonmotile. Intracellular (endosymbiotic) bacteria in Paramecium. Culture free of Paramecium impossible or exceedingly difficult. The ability to produce refractile inclusion (R) bodies was seen as a unique feature of the genus. R bodies are proteinaceous ribbons, approximately 10 µm long, coiled inside the bacterial cell (Figures 1, 2, and 3). The hollow cylindrical structure formed may be 0.4–0.8 µm long and about 0.4 µm in diameter. R bodies unroll when ingested into a phagosome and under certain in vitro conditions (for details see Preer et al., 1974; Quackenbush, 1988; Pond et al., 1989). R bodies are associated with spherical phage-like structures or covalently closed circular DNA plasmids. All species are toxic to certain sensitive strains of paramecia; bacteria confer killer-trait or mate killer-trait upon their host cells. An exception is “C. macronucleorum” from Paramecium duboscqui, where no toxic effects were observed. Cells containing R bodies are usually larger than cells that do not contain R bodies, and contain many spherical phage-like structures of covalently closed, circular, DNA plasmids. Recently, a symbiotic bacterium from Acanthamoeba was included in the genus Caedibacter because of its sequence similarity to Caedibacter caryophilus (Horn et al., 1999). This new Caedibacter species, Candidatus Caedibacter acanthamoebae, does not establish R bodies. Also interesting is the relatively close relationship of Caedibacter to the genus Holospora and to the “NHP bacterium”, etiologic agent of necrotizing hepatopancreatitis in shrimp (Loy et al., 1996; Horn et al., 1999).
Incertae Sedis III. Lyticum	Large rods 0.6–0.8 µm in diameter, straight, curved, or spiral. Length of single forms 3.0–5.0 µm. Numerous peritrichous flagella. Although cultivation independently from Paramecium has been reported, it has not been confirmed. Produce labile toxins which kill sensitive strains of paramecia very quickly by lysis. Gram negative. Nonmotile or almost so, in spite of numerous, well-developed flagella (Figure 1). Occurs in Paramecium biaurelia, P. tetraurelia, and P. octaurelia (Figure 2).
Incertae Sedis IV. Odyssella	Motile, rod-shaped (0.2–0.5 × 0.7–1.0 µm) intracytoplasmic parasite of Acanthamoeba spp. Does not grow axenically. Most virulent at temperatures above 30°C.
Incertae Sedis VI. Pseudocaedibacter	Rods 0.25–0.7 × 0.5–4 μm. Gram negative. Nonmotile. Do not produce R-body-containing cells. May or may not confer a killer trait upon their host paramecia. Occurs in Paramecium primaurelia, P. biaurelia, P. pentaurelia, and P. octaurelia. Whether lacking the ability to produce R bodies justifies separation of the genus Pseudocaedibacter from the genus Caedibacter may be questioned because the newly found endosymbiont from Acanthamoeba polyphaga, Candidatus Caedibacter acanthamoebae, does not establish R bodies but showed 93% sequence similarity (16S rRNA) to Caedibacter caryophilus and was therefore included in the genus Caedibacter (Horn et al., 1999).
Incertae Sedis VII.“Pseudolyticum”	Straight rods, 2.0 × 3.5–14.0 µm. Bacteria are not infective and do not confer a killer trait on their host. Gram negative. Non-motile in spite of numerous flagella. Occur in Paramecium caudatum.
Incertae Sedis VIII. Tectibacter	Straight rods 0.4–0.7 × 1–2 µm. Distinguished by outer covering around its cell wall, visible in sections with the transmission electron microscope. Sparsely flagellated, peritrichous. No known strains are toxic to protozoa. Gram negative. Often observed to be motile. Occur widely among strains of Paramecium primaurelia, P. biaurelia, P. tetraurelia, P. sexaurelia, and P. octaurelia, often with other symbionts (Figure 1).
Orientia	Short rods 0.5–0.8 × 1.2–3.0 µm. Obligately intracellular. Grow free in the cytosol of the host cell; rarely invade the nucleus. Bacterial cells are released surrounded by host cell membrane. Cell walls lack lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. The outer leaflet of the cell wall is considerably thicker than the inner leaflet, unlike the wall of rickettsiae. The genome of Orientia is 1.1–1.5 × 109 Da, larger than that of Rickettsia. Maintained by transovarian transmission in its various trombiculid mite hosts. Etiological agents of scrub typhus in humans. Transmitted to humans by mite larvae. Found in Asia and Australia.
Rickettsia	Short, often paired rods, 0.3–0.5 × 0.8–2.0 μm. The rickettsial envelope has a typical Gram-negative structure with a bilayer inner membrane, a peptidoglycan layer, and a bilayer outer membrane. The cells are often surrounded by a protein microcapsular layer and slime layer. Rickettsiae retain basic fuchsin when stained by the method of Giménez (1964). The organisms are obligately intracellular and reside free in the cytoplasm of the eucaryotic host cell, where they divide by binary fission. Rickettsiae of the spotted fever group (SFG) may also reside in the nucleus of the eucaryotic host cells. Rickettsiae are closely associated with arthropods (ticks, mites, fleas, lice, and other insects) for their maintenance in nature. Their natural cycle usually involves both a vertebrate and an invertebrate host. For some, the arthropod host is both a reservoir and a vector. Transovarian transmission of the agent from the infected female to the next generation is the essential mechanism for the maintenance of many species (Burgdorfer, 1988). Rickettsial cells are usually unstable when separated from host components, except for highly stable forms found in the feces of arthropod hosts; stability can be enhanced by certain proteins, sucrose, and reagents that tend to maintain the integrity of outer membranes, osmolarity, and ATP level. Rickettsiae are best preserved by rapid freezing and storage below −50°C. The cells are rapidly inactivated at 56°C. Rickettsiae derive energy from the metabolism of glutamate via the citric acid cycle, but do not utilize glucose. They transport and metabolize phosphorylated compounds but do not synthesize or degrade nucleoside monophosphates. Rickettsiae are etiological agents of typhus and spotted fevers in humans. There are 21 recognized species.

The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the cell wall is replaced by sphingolipids (Figs. BXII.α88 and BXII.α89). C18:1 ω9c and C18:1 ω7c are the major nonpolar fatty acids and 2-hydroxymyristic acid is the major 2-hydroxy acid (Table BXII.α84).

Chemoorganotrophic, growing on and fermenting 1 mol of glucose or fructose to almost 2 mol of ethanol, 2 mol of CO2, and some organic acids such as lactic acid. Some strains may also utilize sucrose, but other carbon sources are not used. Gluconate can be degraded but does not serve as sole carbon or energy source (Strohdeicher et al., 1 988). Sorbitol and gluconolactone are formed when grown on sucrose or mixtures of glucose and fructose by a so far unique enzyme, glucose-fructose oxidoreductase. Membranes contain pentacyclic triterpenoids of the hopane series (Sahm et al., 1 993). Gelatinase negative. Nitrates are not reduced and indole is not produced. Zymomonas tolerates 5% ethanol and is acid tolerant, growing at pH 3.5–7.5. Good growth is obtained only when a mixture of amino acids is present in the medium, but no one amino acid is essential. All strains require biotin and pantothenate. Zymomonas occurs as a spoiler in beers, ciders, and perries; as fermenting agents in Agave sap, palm sap, and sugarcane juice; and on honeybees and in ripening honey.

Colonies on Bordet–Gengou medium are smooth, convex, pearly, glistening, nearly transparent, and surrounded by a zone of hemolysis without definite periphery. Respiratory metabolism. Chemoorganotrophic. Require nicotinamide, organic sulfur (e.g., cysteine), and organic nitrogen (amino acids). Utilize oxidatively glutamic acid, proline, alanine, aspartic acid, and serine, with production of ammonia and CO2. Litmus milk is made alkaline. Mammalian and avian parasite and pathogen. Most species localize and multiply among the epithelial cilia of the respiratory tract.
Derxia	Cells are rod-shaped with rounded ends, 1.0–1.2 µm × 3.0–6.0 µm, occurring singly or in short chains. Cells are rather pleomorphic, depending on age and the medium. In aging cultures cells often remain together forming long filaments of sometimes locally swollen or distorted cells. Some cells may assume very large lengths (up to 30 µm). Young cells have a homogeneous cytoplasm; older cells show typical large refractile bodies—probably poly-β-hydroxybutyrate—throughout the whole cell. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative.

Optimal temperature, 25–35°C; growth is slow at 15°C, feeble at 40°C; no growth at 50°C. Growth occurs between pH 5.5 and ~9.0; no growth at pH 4.4. Broth cultures turn into a gelatinous mass, but growth near the surface is more luxuriant and forms a thick, tough pellicle. Colonies on agar media are at first slimy and semitransparent, later massive and opaque, highly raised with a wrinkled surface. Older colonies develop a dark mahogany-brown color. Catalase negative. A wide range of sugars, alcohols, and organic acids are oxidized mostly to CO2 and a small amount of acid, probably acetic, when growing in an alkaline medium. Can grow as a facultative hydrogen autotroph. Found in tropical soils (Asia, Africa, South America).
Oligella	Small rods or coccobacilli, usually not exceeding 1 μm in length and often occurring in pairs; cell width is seldom larger than 0.6 μm. Gram negative, noncapsulated, and nonsporeforming. Motility, if present, is by means of peritrichous flagella. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Moderately fastidious chemoorganotrophs growing at 30°C and 37°C. Grow on nutrient agar, but growth is enhanced by the addition of yeast autolysate, serum, or blood.

Burkholderia	Cells single or in pairs, straight or curved rods, but not helical. Dimensions, generally 0.5–1 × 1.5–4 µm. Motile by means of one or, more commonly, several polar flagella. One species (Burkholderia mallei) lacks flagella and is nonmotile. Do not produce sheaths or prosthecae. No resting stages are known. Gram negative. Most species accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) as carbon reserve material. Chemoorganotrophs. Have a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Some species can exhibit anaerobic respiration with nitrate. Strains of some of the species (B. cepacia, B. vietnamiensis) are able to fix N2. Catalase positive. A wide variety of organic compounds can be used as sources of carbon and energy for growth. Although hydroxylated fatty acids are present in the lipids of members of other genera of aerobic pseudomonads, species of Burkholderia are characterized by the presence of hydroxy fatty acids of 14, 16, and 18 carbon atoms (C14:0 3OH and C16:0, and C16:0 2OH, C16:1, and C18:1). The most characteristic of these acids is the C16:0 3OH. Two different ornithine lipids are present in strains of some of the species. Over one-half of the species are pathogenic for plants or animals (including humans). The genus belongs to the ribosomal RNA similarity group II, which can be differentiated from other groups of aerobic pseudomonads by rRNA/DNA hybridization experiments or by rDNA sequencing.
Cupriavidus	Coccoid rods, 0.7–0.9 × 0.9–1.3 µm. Gram negative. Motile by two to ten peritrichous flagella. Chemoheterotrophic. An organic nitrogen source is not required. Glucose not utilized.

Alysiella	Organisms that exist in characteristic flat, ribbon-like multicellular filaments. The long axis of the individual cells is perpendicular to the long axis of the filament. The cells within the filament are paired, and in axenic culture the filament often breaks up into groups of two or four cells. The width of an individual cell (the width of a filament) is about 2.0–3.0 µm, and the length of a cell is about 0.6 µm. The length of the filament is quite variable. The filament does not show either a dorsal-ventral differentiation or a convex-concave curvature in transverse cross-section. The ends of the individual filaments are square. Gram negative. Motile by gliding of the entire filament in the direction of the long axis. Aerobic. Chemoorganotrophic. Some may produce acid aerobically from carbohydrates. Optimal temperature: 37°C. Found in the oral cavity of warm-blooded vertebrates
Aquaspirillum	Rigid, helical cells, 0.2–1.4 µm in diameter; however, one species is vibrioid and one species contains straight-to-curved rods. A polar membrane underlies the cytoplasmic membrane at the cell poles in all species so far examined for this characteristic by electron microscopy. Intracellular poly-β-hydroxybutyrate is formed, except in two species. Some species form thin-walled coccoid bodies, which predominate in cultures of three to four weeks. Gram negative. Motile by polar flagella, generally bipolar tufts; one species is monotrichous, others have a single flagellum at one or at each pole. Aerobic to microaerophilic, having a respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor; a few species can grow anaerobically with nitrate. The optimal growth temperature for most species is 30–32°C. Chemoorganotrophic; however, one species is a facultative hydrogen autotroph. Oxidase positive. Usually catalase and phosphatase positive. Indole and sulfatase negative. Casein, starch, and hippurate are not hydrolyzed. No growth occurs in the presence of 3% NaCl. A few species can denitrify. Nitrogenase activity occurs in some species, but only under microaerobic conditions. Carbohydrates are not usually metabolized, but a few species can attack a limited variety. Amino acids or the salts of organic acids serve as carbon sources. Vitamins are not usually required. Usually occur in stagnant, freshwater environments.
Chromobacterium	Cells straight, round-ended, often coccoid, but usually occuring as rods, 0.6–0.9 × 1.5–3.0 μm, occurring singly, sometimes in pairs or short chains. No definite capsules are evident. No resting stages known. Gram negative. Usually contain poly-β-hydroxy-butyrate crystals (80% of strains positive), but rarely contain metachromatic granules. Motile by means of both a single polar flagellum and, usually, one or more subpolar or lateral flagella. Facultative anaerobes. Minimum temperature for growth 10–15°C; maximum about 40°C; optimal growth at 30–35°C. Optimal pH 7–8; no growth occurs below pH 5. Grow on ordinary peptone media; no distinctive organic growth factor requirements. Colonies are smooth, but rough variants may occur; colonies are of butyrous consistency and are easily emulsified in water. Most strains produce the violet pigment violacein, but strains producing nonpigmented colonies are sometimes encountered, and subcultures of pigmented strains often contain partially or completely unpigmented colonies. Growth in nutrient broth produces a violet ring at the surface with a fragile pellicle. Chemoorganotrophs; most strains (80%) attack carbohydrates fermentatively, some (20%) oxidatively, producing small amounts of acid but usually no gas. Lactate is oxidized to CO2. Usually oxidase positive by the method of Sivendra and Lo (1975). No growth in media containing 6% or more NaCl. Catalase positive, but very sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Indole negative, Voges–Proskauer negative. Nitrate and nitrite reduced. Ammonia produced from peptone. Arginine hydrolyzed. Hydrogen cyanide produced. Resistant to benzylpenicillin, 10 mg/ml.

Soil and water organisms, occasionally causing infections of humans and other mammals. 16S rRNA gene sequence data place Chromobacterium in the class Betaproteobacteria.
Eikenella	Straight rods, 0.3–0.4 × 1.5–04.0 µm, unbranched, with rounded ends and a regular morphology. Short filaments are occasionally formed. Nonsporeforming. Gram negative. Nonmotile, possessing no flagella; however, a “twitching motility” may occur on agar surfaces. Facultatively anaerobic. Optimal growth temperature, 35–37°C. Colonies may appear to corrode the surface of the agar; noncorroding strains may also occur. Nonhemolytic; a slight greening of blood media around colonies may occur. Oxidase positive (Kovacs method). Negative for catalase, urease, arginine dihydrolase, and indole. Lysine-decarboxylase positive. Nitrates are reduced to nitrites.

Formivibrio	Genus description is the same as for the description of Formivibrio citricus.
Iodobacter	Straight, round-ended rods, 0.7 × 3.0–3.5 μm, occurring singly, in pairs, sometimes in chains, and occasionally as long filaments. Definite capsules are not evident. No resting stages known. Gram negative. Motile by means of both a single polar flagellum and usually one or more subpolar or lateral flagella. Facultative anaerobes. Grow on ordinary peptone media. On low-nutrient media, such as nutrient agar containing a quarter of the normal concentration of nutrients, colonies are usually very thin, with rough surfaces and irregular edges, and may spread to 1 cm or more in diameter; they are of butyrous consistency and are easily emulsified in water. Most strains produce the violet pigment violacein, and this shows most intensely in the centers of spreading colonies, but strains producing nonpigmented colonies (which are easily overlooked) are sometimes encountered. Occasional strains may spread only poorly and may even produce slightly gelatinous colonies, whose appearances are reminiscent of those produced by Chromobacterium and Janthinobacterium species. On full-strength nutrient agar and other routine, richer media, colonies may show less tendency to spread. Growth in quarter-strength nutrient broth is moderate after 24 h at 25°C, with uniform turbidity and a violet ring at the surface, but no pellicle; strains that produce long filaments may appear to gel in broths. Chemoorganotrophs; attack carbohydrates fermentatively, producing small amounts of acid, but no gas. Grow at 4–30°C, with optimal growth at ~25°C.
Kingella	Straight rods, 0.6–1.0 × 1.0 to 3.0 μm, with rounded or square ends. Occur in pairs and sometimes in short chains. Endospores are not formed. Gram negative, but there is a tendency to resist Gram-decolorization. Nonmotile by normal tests, but may be fimbriated (piliated) and show “twitching motility.” Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic; grow best aerobically, but can grow weakly under anaerobic conditions on blood agar. Optimal growth temperature, 33–37°C. Two types of colonies occur on blood agar: (a) a spreading, corroding type associated with “twitching motility,” fimbriation, and transformation competence, and (b) a smooth, convex type not showing “twitching motility”, fimbriation, or competence. Oxidase positive (when tested with tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine; the dimethyl reagent may give weak or negative reactions). Catalase negative. Coagulated serum is not liquefied. Urease- and indole-negative. Phenylalanine deaminase activity is negative or weak. Chemoorganotrophic. d -Glucose and a limited number of other carbohydrates are fermented with production of acid, but no gas.

Microvirgula	Curved rods, occurring singly, in pairs, or in clusters. Motile. Gram negative. Oxidase and catalase positive. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor; however, anaerobic respiration occurs in the presence of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide, with the formation of N2. Denitrification is not repressed under aerobic conditions. Chemoorganotrophic. Growth occurs on a variety of carbon sources including acetate, succinate, propionate, ethanol, methanol, and glycerol, but not on sugars. Belongs to the Betaproteobacteria. Isolated from an up-flow anoxic filter inoculated with activated sludges.
Neisseria	Cocci 0.6–1.9 µm in diameter, occurring singly but often in pairs with adjacent sides flattened; two species (Neisseria elongata and N. weaveri) are exceptions and consist of short rods 0.5 µm wide, often arranged as diplobacilli or in chains. Division of the coccal species is in two planes at right angles to each other, sometimes resulting in tetrads. Capsules and fimbriae (pili) may be present. Endospores are not present. Gram negative, but there is a tendency to resist decolorization. Swimming motility does not occur and flagella are absent. Aerobic. Some species produce a yellow carotenoid pigment. Some species are nutritionally fastidious and hemolytic. Optimal temperature, 35–37°C. Oxidase positive. Catalase positive except most strains of N. elongata. Carbonic anhydrase is produced by all species. All species reduce nitrite except N. gonorrhoeae and N. canis. Neisseria spp. produce acid from carbohydrates by oxidation, not fermentation. Chemoorganotrophic. Exotoxins are not produced. Some species are saccharolytic. Inhabitants of the mucous membranes of mammals. Some species are primary pathogens of humans. The genus Neisseria belongs to the family Neisseriaceae of the Betaproteobacteria.
Prolinoborus	Straight rods, 0.7–0.9 μm in width. Cells are approximately 5–10 µm in length, but old cultures may contain cells up to 42 µm long. Curved or S-shaped variants have been reported to occur in one strain after prolonged serial transfer. A polar membrane underlies the cytoplasmic membrane. Intracellular poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules are present in the rods. Extensive conversion of the rod-shaped cells to round forms (“coccoid bodies”) occurs in older cultures. Upon initial isolation, the cells form highly viscous flocs, within which the cells swim steadily in straight lines. The floc-forming ability is gradually lost during subsequent serial transfers, and the growth eventually becomes turbid. Cells have bipolar flagellar fascicles composed of up to 11 flagella. The fascicles can be seen clearly by dark-field microscopy and show unusual and distinctive behavior when the cells are suspended in ordinary, nonviscous media: helical wave propagation with waves progressing from base to tip, an ability to coil up like springs, and basal bending accompanied by a change in wavelength. In such nonviscous media the cells do not swim; instead, they exhibit an ineffectual “floundering about” movement; however, when they are suspended in a medium of high viscosity (10–200 centipoise, obtained by the use of agents such as DNA or methylcellulose “400 centipoise”), they swim steadily in straight lines. Optimal temperature, 30°C; no growth at 20°C or 40°C. Catalase and oxidase positive. Carbohydrates are not catabolized. Pyruvate and proline are the most effective sole carbon sources. Proline can be used a sole source of nitrogen and carbon. Nitrogenase activity (ability to reduce acetylene) occurs under microaerobic conditions. Habitat: pond water.
Simonsiella	Organisms that exist in characteristic multicellular filaments that are flat rather than cylindrical and often segmented into groups of eight cells. The width of an individual cell is greater than its length. The long axis of an individual cell is perpendicular to the long axis of the filament. The diameter of the filaments (the width of the individual cells) may vary from about 2.0 to 8.0 µm, and the length of filaments may vary from about 10.0 to over 50.0 µm. Individual cells within the filaments may be from about 0.5 to 1.3 µm long. In thin sections cut perpendicular to the long axis of the filament, the cells are flattened and curved to yield a crescent-shaped, convex–concave (dorsal–ventral) asymmetry. The ends of the individual filaments are rounded. Gram negative. Gliding motility of the entire filament in the direction of the long axis when the flat side of the filament is in contact with a surface. Chemoorganotrophs. Aerobic. Some may produce acid aerobically from carbohydrates. Optimal temperature: 37°C. Found in the oral cavity of warm-blooded vertebrates.

Aerobic to microaerophilic, having a respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. No growth anaerobically. Sulfur inclusions are not formed from hydrogen sulfide or thiosulfate. Chemoorganotrophic. Two species are oligotrophic and grow best at low nutrient concentrations; one species can grow luxuriantly on rich media, e.g., 0.5% peptone broth. Various organic acids and amino acids are used as carbon and energy sources. Found in dung, soil, water with decaying plant material, sediments, and in association with oscillatorian mats.
Vogesella	Straight rods, 0.5 × 3.5 μm, mainly occurring singly but also in pairs and short chains. Occasional vibrioid rods may occur. Most strains form filamentous rods and long chains when grown on nitrogen-limiting agar. Motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules occur, especially under nitrogen limitation. Colonies are a deep royal blue with a metallic copper-colored sheen at 36 to 48 h, due to production of indigoidine (C10H8N4O4 or 5,5′-diamino-4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-diazadiphenoquinone-[2,2′]). Oxidase and catalase positive. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. All strains can carry out denitrification with production of gas. Nonfermentative. Citrate, several amino acids and peptides, and some monosaccharides are utilized as carbon sources. Starch, pectin, and sugars associated with pectin (i.e., arabinose and galactose) are not metabolized. Nonlipolytic. Casein, gelatin, and esculin are not hydrolyzed. Indole positive.

Gallionella	Gram-negative, bean-shaped cells, usually 0.5–0.8 × 1.6–2.5 µm, that secrete an extracellular twisted stalk from the concave side, 0.3–0.5 µm in width and up to 400 µm or more in length. The stalk is composed of numerous 2 nm-wide fibers and is produced under microaerophilic conditions when cells are in late exponential or stationary growth phase. Motile by means of a polar flagellum. Microaerophilic; chemolithotrophic growth can be obtained in vitro using oxygen and ferrous iron concentration gradients in a salt medium with CO2 as sole carbon source (Table BXII.β.108). Mixotrophic metabolism has been demonstrated with glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Can be found where anaerobic groundwater with ferrous iron reaches an oxygen-containing environment. Belongs to the Betaproteobacteria , family Gallionellaceae, with one known species, G. ferruginea. Most closely related species according to 16S rDNA sequence analysis is the chemolithotroph Nitrosospira multiformis, distantly related with a 16S rDNA sequence similarity of 90%.
Nitrosolobus	Pleomorphic, lobate cells (Figure 1a) that divide by constriction. Gram-negative cell wall. Motile cells possess 1–20 peritrichous flagella, each 15 nm wide and 2.5–5.0 µm long. Cells are partially compartmentalized by intracytoplasmic membranes (Figure 1b). Carboxysomes are not observed. Most, but not all, strains are urease positive. Glycogen inclusions and polyphosphates are located primarily in the peripheral compartments of the cell. Commonly distributed in agricultural amended soils. Occasionally observed in freshwater environments.
Nitrosomonas	Spherical, ellipsoidal, or rod-shaped cells (Figures 1–3, and 4). Strains belonging to the same species are generally very similar in the shape and size of their cells. Cells occur singly or occasionally in short chains. Depending on the growth conditions, cells are free-living or embedded in slimy aggregates. Gram-negative cell wall, but some marine representatives show an additional outer cell-wall layer composed of subunits arranged in a macromolecular array (Watson and Remsen, 1969). Motile cells possess polar flagella. Intracytoplasmic membranes are arranged as flattened vesicles, primarily in the peripheral cytoplasm (Figures 1–3, and 4). Carboxysomes (Figure 5) are present in some species. Urea can be used as ammonia source by many, but not all, species. The Ks values for oxidation of NH3 range between 0.6 and 158 μM. Most, if not all, species are predominantly or exclusively present in special environments.
Nitrosospira	Cells are tightly coiled spirals (Figure 1a), 0.3–0.4 µm in width, with 3–20 turns. Occasionally, vibrioid cells occur in cultures. By phase-microscopy, spherical forms 0.8–1.2 µm in diameter may be observed in cultures. Gram-negative cell wall. Intracytoplasmic membranes are rare (Figure 1b), but tubular invaginations are observed. Motile strains possess peritrichous flagella. 1–6 flagella are observed, each 3–5 µm in length. Urease-positive strains, as well as urease-negative strains, exist in all species. Common in grasslands, heath, forest soils, and mountainous environments. Some strains have been isolated from building stones and from acid soils (pH 4.0–4.5). Occasionally observed in freshwater environments. Using molecular ecological methods, the existence of Nitrosospira-like groups in marine environment has repeatedly been indicated (Stephen et al., 1996; Phillips et al., 1999; Bano and Hollibaugh, 2000). However this has not yet been proven via isolation of strains.
Spirillum	Rigid, helical cells, 1.4–1.7 × 14–60 μm. A polar membrane underlies the cytoplasmic membrane at the cell poles and is visible in ultrathin sections. Intracellular poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules are formed. Coccoid bodies are not formed. Gram negative. Motile by large bipolar tufts of flagella having a long wavelength and about one helical turn; these are composed of approximately 75 flagella and are easily visible by dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy. Microaerophilic in ordinary liquid media, but can grow aerobically in special media or with certain supplements. Colonies on solid media can be obtained only under special conditions. Have a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Growth does not occur anaerobically with nitrate. Optimal temperature, 30°C. Oxidase and phosphatase positive. Catalase negative. Indole and sulfatase negative. Casein, starch, esculin, gelatin, DNA, and RNA are not hydrolyzed. Inhibited by extremely low levels of hydrogen peroxide in the culture medium. NaCl levels above 0.02% are inhibitory. Phosphate levels greater than 0.01 M are inhibitory.

Occur in stagnant, freshwater environments.
Azoarcus	Straight to slightly curved rods, 0.4–1.5 × 1.1–4.0 μm. Cell pairs often appear slightly S-shaped. In most species, some elongated cells (8–12 µm) occur in late-log or stationary-phase cultures on medium containing malic acid and N2 or ammonium as nitrogen source. Cells are highly motile by means of one polar flagellum. Accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules. Gram negative. Some species are nitrogen fixers; these require microaerobic conditions for growth on N2. On semisolid nitrogen-free media, microaerophilic growth can be observed as veil-like pellicles developing several mm below the surface and moving to the medium surface during growth. In most species, colonies on VM agar1 supplemented with ethanol develop a nondiffusible yellowish pigment. Optimal temperature for growth 30–40°C; no growth occurs at 45°C. Chemoorganoheterotrophic. Bacteria have a strictly respiratory metabolism with O2 as the terminal electron acceptor, except one species. Alternatively, under anaerobic conditions, nitrate can be used for dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Oxidase positive. Grow well on salts of organic acids such as L-malate, succinate, fumarate, DL-lactate; also grow well on ethanol, on L-glutamate, but not on mono- or disaccharides except for species that are not plant-associated. These soil-borne species utilize a variety of aromatic substrates as sole carbon sources under denitrifying conditions. Nitrate can be used as a nitrogen source (assimilatory nitrate reduction). Growth factor requirements vary: some strains depend on p-aminobenzoic acid or on cobalamine. All investigated species have C16:1 cellular fatty acids; all species except one have C16:1 ω7c and C18:1 as the major cellular fatty acids.

Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism; never fermentative. Molecular oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide are used as terminal electron acceptors, and the nitrogen oxides are reduced to N2O or N2; one species also uses selenate, which is reduced to elemental Se. Optimal temperature 28–40°C. All species grow at pH 7.5; pH optima of different species range from 7.2 to 8.4. Chemoorganotrophic, using various organic acids, amino acids, and aromatic and aliphatic compounds as sole substrates. Only a few carbohydrates are utilized. Ammonium and nitrate salts can be used as sole nitrogen sources. No N2 fixation known. Not proteolytic on casein or gelatin. Starch, cellulose, chitin, and agar are not hydrolyzed. Occur in polluted freshwater and wet soil environments and wastewater treatment plants.
Zoogloea	The following description is representative of the genus based on well-characterized isolates recovered directly from naturally occurring, typical, fingered zoogloeae: Straight to slightly curved, plump rods, 1.0–1.3 × 2.1–3.6 µm, with rounded ends; sometimes tapered to a blunt point at one or both poles. Nonsporeforming and noncystforming. Cells in older cultures are demonstrably encapsulated. Gram negative. Actively motile, especially in young cultures, by means of a single polar flagellum. Intracellular granules of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate are formed on media containing the salts of organic acids. Cultures enter into formation of flocs and films in liquid media at late growth stages; the cells become embedded in gelatinous matrices to form zoogloeae, which may be distinguished by a “tree-like” or “finger-like” morphology. Young colonies on solid media under a normal air atmosphere are translucent and punctiform, but may increase to 1 or 2 mm in diameter and exhibit opaque centers. Nonpigmented. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen or nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Denitrification occurs with formation of N2. Optimal temperature for growth, 28–37°C. Optimal pH, 7.0–7.5. Oxidase positive. Weakly catalase positive. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is not formed from carbohydrates except for xylose, glycerol, and ethanol, which are attacked oxidatively by a few strains. Proteolytic on gelatin. Most strains are urease positive. Litmus milk is unchanged. Hydrogen sulfide is usually not produced from cysteine. Major carbon sources include salts of several organic acids (e.g., lactate, pyruvate, and fumarate), dicarboxylic amino acids (e.g., aspartate, glutamate, and asparagine), alcohols, and salts of certain aromatic acids (e.g., benzoate and m-toluate). Benzene derivatives are attacked by meta cleavage of the ring structure. Organic nitrogen compounds (e.g., dicarboxylic amino acids) and ammonia serve as nitrogen sources; nitrate is unsuitable. Specific growth factor requirements, if any, are unknown. Major cellular fatty acids are palmitoleic (C16:1) and 3-hydroxydecanoic (C10:0 3OH) acids. Major respiratory quinones are Q-8 and RQ-8. The major polyamine is 2-hydroxyputrescine. Occur free-living in organically polluted fresh waters and in wastewaters at all stages of treatment.
Bacteriovorax	Members of the genus Bacteriovorax exhibit the same general morphological and life cycle features as described for the genus Bdellovibrio. However, genetically the two genera vary considerably, with Bacteriovorax sp. having a lower mol% G + C content, little to no DNA–DNA hybridization (<4%), and <82% rDNA similarity with Bdellovibrio .
Bdellovibrio	Vibrios, 0.20–0.4 × 0.5–1.4 μm. Motile by a single, polar, sheathed flagellum. Gram negative. Prey upon Gram-negative bacteria. Have a predatory lifestyle characterized by two distinct phases, a free-living attack phase and an intraperiplasmic growth phase (Figure 1). Prey-independent mutants that have lost their requirement for prey cells occur spontaneously and can be isolated in the laboratory. Some of these prey-independent mutants retain the ability to grow predaciously and are considered to be facultative with respect to their requirement for prey cells. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Contain cytochromes a, c, and b. Mesophilic. Oxidase positive. Catalase variable. Occur in fresh and salt water, soil, and sewage.
Micavibrio	Curved rods 0.25–0.4 × 0.5–1.0 μm. Occur singly. Motile by a single, sheathless, polar flagellum approximately 13–15 nm in diameter. Gram negative. Electron microscopy demonstrates the cell wall infrastructure to be consistent with Gram-negative bacteria (Lambina et al., 1982). Exoparasitic on other bacteria. Attach themselves to their bacterial prey by the end opposite the flagellum and position themselves parallel to the longitudinal axis of the prey cell. They remain along the outside of the prey cell (unlike the genus Bdellovibrio, which penetrates its prey). After attachment, the cells lose their motility, multiply by binary fission, and eventually cause lysis of their prey cell.

Motile, generally by means of a single flagellum located at a lateral or subpolar position; cells exhibit a characteristic propeller-like movement. Some strains have polar flagella. Strictly anaerobic. Possess mainly a respiratory type of metabolism with elemental sulfur serving as the terminal electron acceptor, and being reduced to H2S (dissimilatory sulfur reduction).

Occur regularly in anoxic sediments of salt lakes and in marine or brackish habitats; have also been enriched from freshwater sediments.
Desulfuromusa	Slightly curved or rod-shaped cells 0.4–0.8 × 1–6 μm. Motile by means of a single, subpolarly inserted flagellum. Gram negative. Spore formation not observed. Strictly anaerobic, having mainly a respiratory type of metabolism; however, fermentative growth may occur with fumarate or malate as the sole substrate. Chemoorganotrophic; all species utilize acetate, propionate, succinate, lactate, pyruvate, oxaloacetate, malate, maleate, glutamate, alanine, and aspartate as electron donors and as carbon sources; these substrates are completely oxidized to CO2. Alcohols and sugars are not utilized. S0 is used as terminal electron acceptor and is reduced to H2S (dissimilatory sulfur reduction).

Growth occurs chemoorganotrophically with Fe(III) serving as the sole electron acceptor. The organic electron donor is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide. Vitamins are not required for growth, but growth is enhanced by their presence. Growth is also enhanced in media containing FeCl2 as a reducing agent.
Trichlorobacter	The description of the genus Trichlorobacter is the same as that of Trichlorobacter thiogenes.
Archangium	Vegetative cells are long, slender, needle-shaped rods with tapering ends. Fruiting bodies without sporangioles, contorted strings of myxospores in hardened slime forming cushion-shaped masses, very variable in shape and size, may separate into packets when put under pressure. Myxospores short, fat rods with rounded ends to almost spherical, optically refractile. Swarm colonies with branched radial veins in a tough slime sheet. Does not degrade chitin.
Cystobacter	The history of the genus Cystobacter and the problems associated with its recognition are discussed above in the introduction to the family. The fruiting body shape and structure of Cystobacter is similar to fruiting bodies produced by Polyangium, Sorangium, Byssophaga, Jahnia, Pyxicoccus, and to a certain extent, Stigmatella hybrida. The genus as it is presented here still is heterogeneous and probably comprises at least three different genera. One group of species, with Cystobacter fuscus as the main representative, has slender, often slightly C- or S-shaped bent, rod-shaped myxospores with more or less tapering ends. Many strains of this group are efficient chitin degraders. The second group, represented by Cystobacter disciformis, has myxospores that are stout, short, fat rods, very much like myxospores of Archangium gephyra. These organisms rarely attack chitin. A third group, centered around Cystobacter gracilis, has delicate vegetative cells with tapering ends, and small myxospores that are straight or slightly bent rods with rounded ends. Analysis of the available 16S rRNA sequences separates at least the first two groups rather neatly (Spröer et al., 1999).
Hyalangium gen. nov	Vegetative cells are delicate, slender rods with tapering ends. Fruiting bodies consist of small spherical sporangioles that are often empty and then look glassy and transparent, arranged in extended, dense sheets, or often, in chains.

Fruiting bodies very variable in shape and size even within one culture: pustules, ridges, slabs, and irregular disks, often with finger-like projections, or raised and bizarre coralloid, of cartilaginous consistency. Swarm colonies as are typical for the family. The organisms do not utilize mono- and disaccharides, but may degrade polysaccharides, like starch, into tri- and oligosaccharides, which can be taken up and metabolized.
Myxococcus	Vegetative cells are slender rods with tapering ends, either cigar-shaped or slender and boat-shaped, measuring about 0.8 × 3–6 µm. When typical, the fruiting bodies are soft, slimy globular masses, knobs, or heads, constricted at the base or on a slime stalk (but see comments on the family). Of the proteolytic–bacteriolytic nutritional type. Common organisms in soil, in freshwater, and on dung of herbivores. Readily obtained when rabbit, hare, or sheep droppings are incubated in a moist chamber at 30°C.
Pyxicoccus gen. nov.	Vegetative cells are slender rods with tapering ends, 0.7–0.8 × 3–8 µm. Myxospores spherical, often somewhat deformed, optically retractile, 1.4–1.8 µm in diameter (sometimes up to 2.4 µm). Fruiting bodies consist of more or less spherical sporangioles with a distinct outer wall, clustered in sori of variable size. In culture, degenerate fruiting bodies resembling those of Corallococcus coralloides may be produced. Swarm colonies as are typical for the family: soft and slimy, with snaking, undulating veins, without striking pigmentation. Of the proteolytic-bacteriolytic nutritional type.
Nannocystis	Characteristics as given for the family. Nannocystis is perhaps the most common of all myxobacteria. It may be obtained from soil, decaying plant material, and similar substrates. It was overlooked for a long time because of its tiny sporangioles; it is best isolated on streaks of living E. coli on water agar. The swarm colonies of Nannocystis do not adsorb Congo red. The phenotypic characteristics of Nannocystis strains are extremely variable, which makes distinguishing species difficult. Only two species are named in this edition. But a number of variants listed under N. exedens may qualify as species of their own. Representative strains have been deposited for further study.

Fruiting bodies consist of spherical or polyhedral sporangioles, usually in sedentary sori, on agar plates often deep within the substrate, sometimes surrounded by a prominent slime layer, or matrix. Myxospores morphologically similar to vegetative cells but optically refractile. The swarm colonies (Figure 2) often etch the agar producing deep tracks and tunnels, holes, and pits; often penetrate the agar deeply with a curtain-like swarm edge; swarms often not coherent but broken up into many small, scattered groups of cells that migrate independently, like pseudoplasmodia.

Growth in a mineral medium requires the vitamins thiamine, nicotinamide, and 1,4-naphthoquinone. Isolated from a sewage sludge bacterial consortium enriched on 3-chlorobenzoate.
Smithella	Elongated, slightly sinuous rods, 0.5 μm in diameter, with round ends. Weakly motile. Gram negative. Endospores have not been observed. Strictly anaerobic. Mesophilic. Grows on crotonate as energy source; also capable of using butyrate, propionate, malate, and fumarate in syntrophic association with H2- or formate-utilizing microorganisms. Catabolism of propionate involves its reductive carboxylation to butyrate (or butyryl-CoA).
Syntrophus	Cells are rod shaped with rounded ends, 0.5–0.8 × 1.0–2.0 μm. Occur singly and in pairs. Gram negative. Endospores not formed. The type species is motile by means of monotrichous polar flagella in the early stage of growth, other species show no motility. Strictly anaerobic and chemoorganotrophic. Possesses a fermentative type of metabolism. Crotonate is fermented by all species, whereas aromatic compounds such as gentisate, hydroquinone, and cinnamate are only fermented by some species. Some substrates, such as benzoate or fatty acids, are oxidized in the presence of H2/formate-utilizing methanogenic or sulfate-reducing partner bacteria. Some species can grow on some substrates in the presence of crotonate as electron acceptor. Substrate oxidation is incomplete and leads to acetate. Sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, sulfur, and nitrate are not used as electron acceptors. Cells contain cytochromes and menaquinones. Optimal growth temperature, 28–37°C. Occur in anoxic freshwater sediment or sludge from anaerobic wastewater treatment facilities.

Chemoautotrophic or chemoorganotrophic, using H2 (+ CO2), formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, lactate, pyruvate, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol as electron donors and carbon sources. Organic substrates are completely oxidized to CO2 via the anaerobic C1-pathway (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway, Wood-pathway) as indicated by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity, but transient excretion of acetate, isobutyrate, and propionate can occur. For chemoautotrophic growth, H2 serves as the electron donor and CO2 as the carbon source. Sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate serve as terminal electron acceptors and are reduced to H2S. Sulfur is not reduced. No growth by fermentation in the absence of an external electron acceptor.
Desulfovirga	Rod-shaped cells, 0.8–2 × 2.2–4 μm. Occur singly or in pairs. Spore formation is not observed. Gram negative. Motile by a single polar flagellum.

Electron donors are completely oxidized to CO2. Sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and sulfur serve as terminal electron acceptors and are reduced to H2S. Nitrate is not used as a terminal electron acceptor. Optimal growth temperature, 35°C. Media containing a reductant and vitamins are necessary for growth. Cells contain cytochrome c, but no desulfoviridin. Desulfovirga species occur in freshwater habitats.
Syntrophobacter	Straight rods with rounded ends, 0.6–1.2 × 1.0–4.5 µm, sometimes oval to ellipsoid, occur singly and in pairs. May form short chains and filamentous cells (up to 35 µm). Gram negative. Endospores not formed. Strictly anaerobic chemoorganotroph. Mesophilic. Growth occurs at neutral pH (6.2–8.0) in low salinity media. Growth occurs by syntrophic metabolism and sulfate reduction. Propionate oxidation to acetate and CO2 requires the presence of either a H2/formate-using organism (methanogen or sulfate reducer) or sulfate as the electron acceptor. Acetate and other fatty acids not oxidized. Some species grow fermentatively with pyruvate, malate, or fumarate. Lactate and propanol may serve as electron donors for syntrophic metabolism or sulfate reduction. Other common bacterial substrates such as sugars and aromatic compounds are not used either in coculture with a H2/formate-using organism or in pure culture with sulfate as the electron acceptor. Sulfite or thiosulfate, but not nitrate, may be used as the electron acceptor. Habitat is sludge from anaerobic waste treatment facilities.

Cells of most species are motile with a characteristic corkscrewlike motion by means of a single polar unsheathed flagellum at one or both ends of the cell. The flagella may be 2–3 times the length of the cells. Cells of other species are nonmotile (Campylobacter gracilis) or have multiple flagella (Campylobacter showae). Occasionally differences in the number of flagella shown by cells in a single culture are seen (Campylobacter hyointestinalis).
Sulfurospirillum	Slender, vibrioid to spirally curved rods, 0.1–0.5 × 1.0–3 µm. May form helical chains of two or more cells. Motile by polar flagella. Gram negative. Nonsporeforming. Microaerobic, with respiratory oxidation of succinate, fumarate, malate, lactate, or pyruvate, but not acetate. Oxidase positive. Carbohydrates are not oxidized or fermented. Reduces S0. Fumarate may be fermented under anoxic conditions. Free living, found in freshwater and marine environments. Temperature growth range from 8 to 36°C.

Helicobacter	Cells may be curved, spiral, or fusiform rods, 0.2–1.2 × 1.5–10.0 µm. Spiral cells may be tightly or loosely wound depending on the species, and on the age and condition of the culture examined. Cells in old cultures or those exposed to air become coccoid. Ultrastructural studies show that periplasmic fibers may be observed on the cell surface of a few taxa and an electrondense glycocalyx- or capsule-like layer has been observed on the cell surface of some species. Nonsporeforming. Gram negative. Motile with a rapid corkscrew- or slower wave-like motion due to flagellar activity. Multiple sheathed flagella are seen in most species, frequently with a bipolar distribution. Typical cell morphologies of various Helicobacter species are shown in Figs. BXII.ε.5 and BXII.ε.6.
Thiovulum	Cells are round to ovoid, 5–25 μm in diameter. Cytoplasm is often concentrated at one end of the cell, with the remaining space being occupied by a large vacuole. Cytoplasm normally contains orthorhombic sulfur inclusions, which are generally concentrated at one end and often almost filling cells completely (Figure 1). The amount of sulfur present in the cells varies with the H2S supply, and cells may be temporarily fully devoid of sulfur inclusions. The number of greenish bodies (up to 5 μm in diameter), thought to be storage material, increases with decreasing numbers of sulfur globules (Hinze, 1913). Cells are rapidly motile by peritrichous flagella (Figure 2; de Boer et al., 1961). Swimming velocity of over 600 μm s -1 , some of the highest recorded in the bacterial world (Garcia-Pichel, 1989). Forward movement is accompanied by rotation around the long axis. Unlike most motile bacteria, Thiovulum cells do swim backwards or tumble. Cells possess a fibrillar, or antapical organelle at the posterior end of the cell. Its function is to secrete a slime stalk or thread (Figure 2) which is used by cells to attach to solid surfaces. No resting stages are known.
Wolinella	Helical, curved, or straight, unbranched cells, 0.5–1.0 × 2–6 µm, with rounded or tapered ends. Endospores are not produced. Gram negative.

Photobacterium	Plump, straight rods, 0.8–1.3 × 1.8–2.4 μm; some coccobacillary and bipolar. Involution forms are usually seen in old cultures or under adverse conditions of cultivation. Gram negative. Motile by 1–3 unsheathed polar flagella; some species nonmotile. Facultative anaerobic. Chemoorganotrophic, having both a respiratory and a fermentative type of metabolism. Optimal growth temperature range appears to be 18–25°C, except for the psychrophilic species P. profundum. Sodium ions are required for growth. D-Glucose and D-mannose are catabolized with the production of acid and, in the case of P. damselae subsp. damselae, P. iliopiscarium, and P. phosphoreum, with gas. Oxidase reaction is variable. Most strains are lysine decarboxylase and arginine di-hydrolase positive. Ornithine decarboxylase negative. Accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PBH) under certain conditions of cultivation; do not use the exogenous monomer β-hydroxybutyrate. Most strains grow in a minimal medium containing a seawater base, d-glucose, and NH4Cl; other strains also require L-methionine. Utilize D-glucose, D-fructose, glycerol, and D-mannose. Some species are bioluminescent.
Salinivibrio	Gram-negative curved rods (0.5–06 × 1.0–3.2 µm). Cells occur singly, in pairs, or occasionally united by S shapes or spirals. Motile by one polar flagellum. Spores are not formed.
Vibrio	Small, straight, slightly curved, curved, or comma-shaped rods, 0.5–0.8 × 1.4–2.6 µm. Involution forms often occur in old cultures and are formed under adverse growth conditions. Do not form endospores or microcysts. Gram negative. In liquid media, motile by monotrichous or multitrichous polar flagella enclosed in a sheath continuous with the outer membrane of the cell wall. On solid media, some species synthesize numerous lateral flagella with a wavelength shorter than that of the sheathed polar flagellum. Facultative anaerobes capable of both fermentative and respiratory metabolism. Molecular oxygen is a universal electron acceptor. Most do not denitrify or fix molecular nitrogen. All are chemoorganotrophs; most are able to grow in a mineral medium containing D-glucose as the sole carbon source and NH +as the sole nitrogen source. A few strains have organic growth factor requirements. Na4 +stimulates growth of all species and is an absolute requirement for most; the minimal concentration necessary for optimal growth ranges from 5 to 700 mM (0.029–4.1%). Most species grow well in media containing a seawater base. All ferment D-glucose producing acid but rarely gas; several species produce acetoin and acetyl methyl carbinol (positive Voges–Proskauer test). Most ferment and utilize D-fructose, maltose, and glycerol; are oxidase positive and reduce nitrate to nitrite. Several grow at 4°C; all grow at 20°C; most grow at 30°C; many grow at 35–37°C. A few species are bioluminescent, as are a few strains of normally nonluminescent species. Primarily aquatic; species distribution is usually dependent on Na+ and nutrient content of the water as well as its temperature. Very common in marine and estuarine environments and on the surfaces and in the intestinal contents of marine animals. Species with a low Na+ requirement are also found in freshwater habitats. Twelve species occur in human clinical specimens; 11 of these are apparently pathogenic for humans, causing diarrhea or extraintestinal infections. Several species cause diseases of other vertebrates and invertebrates.
Acidithiobacillus	Obligately acidophilic, aerobic, Gram-negative rods, 0.4 × 2.0 µm, motile by one or more flagella.

Aeromonas	Cells straight, coccobacillary to bacillary with rounded ends, 0.3–1.0 × 1.0–3.5 µm. Occur singly, in pairs, or rarely in short chains. Gram negative. Most species are motile by a single, polar flagellum of 1.7 µm wavelength; peritrichous flagella may be formed on solid media in young cultures and lateral flagella occur in some species. Facultatively anaerobic. Chemoorganotrophic, displaying oxidative and fermentative metabolism of D-glucose. Acid and often acid with gas produced from many carbohydrates, especially D-glucose. Nitrate is reduced to nitrite. A variety of exoenzymes such as arylamidases, amylase, DNase, esterases, peptidases, and other hydrolytic enzymes are produced. Main cellular fatty acids are hexadecanoic acid (C16:0), hexadecenoic acid (C16:1), and octadecenoic acid (C18:1). Usually oxidase positive and catalase positive. Optimum growth temperature varies between 22°C and 37°C; growth temperature can range from 0 to 45°C, and some species do not grow at 35°C. Generally resistant to 150 μg of the vibriostatic agent 2,4 diamino-6, 7-diisopropylpteridine (0/129). Occur in fresh, brackish, tap, well, and chlorinated water, as well as biosolids and sewage. Some of the species have been associated with disease in a wide variety of warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals, including humans, domestic animals, frogs, fresh and salt water fish, and invertebrates. The phylogenetic position of Aeromonas, as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, is in the Gammaproteobacteria, with its closest relatives in the families Vibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. 16S rDNA sequences (signature sequences) have been determined for nearly all validly named species and are deposited in GenBank, EMBL, or RDP databases (Table BXII.γ180).
Oceanimonas	Gram-negative motile rods (0.7–1.2 × 2.0–2.5 mm). Up to four polar flagella. Respiratory metabolism using O2. Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, phosphatidylglyerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol are the main phospholipids. Require Na+ for growth
Incertae Sedis Tolumonas	Cells are nonmotile, Gram-negative rods (2.5–3.2 × 0.9–1.2 µm) that occur singly or in pairs. Growth occurs under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic cultures are catalase and oxidase negative; aerobic cultures are catalase positive and oxidase negative. Toluene is produced from phenylalanine, phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenylpyruvate only in the presence of an additional carbon source. Phenol is produced when phenylalanine is replaced by tyrosine. The optimum conditions for anaerobic growth are 22°C and pH 7.2.

DNA relatedness tests have shown that Providencia are more closely related to Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis than to other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Although 16S RNA sequence data are not available for the Providencia species, the close relationship of Providencia to Proteus indicates that Providencia, like Proteus, belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria within the family Enterobacteriaceae.

Sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA of four Rahnella strains clearly placed the genus within the Gammaproteobacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Highest 16S rDNA sequence similarity to Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 9610T (97.7%). By omitting the hypervariable regions VI and V5 (corresponding to E. coli base positions 147–1490; Brosius et al., 1978), Hafnia alvei ATCC 13337T showed the highest sequence similarity (96.63%) to R. aquatilis ATCC 33071T.

Wigglesworthia	Obligate intracellular, bacteriome-tissue associated, primary endosymbionts of tsetse flies. In the adult fly, the bacteria lie free in the cytoplasm of differentiated epithelial cells, bacteriocytes, which form the U-shaped bacteriome organ (previously referred to as mycetome) in the anterior midgut (Figs. 1A, 1B). The endosymbionts are rod shaped (2–4 × 8–10 µm) with a typical Gram-negative cell wall and inner membrane structure, lack flagella (Fig. 1C). The cells appear to divide by binary fission. The bacteria are obligate intracellular organisms, as their experimental elimination from tsetse by procaryotic-specific antibiotic treatment, by lysozyme, or with symbiont-specific antibodies provided in the blood meal results in retarded growth of the insect and a decrease in egg production, causing loss of the ability of these aposymbiotic hosts to reproduce (Hill et al., 1973; Nogge, 1976, 1978, 1980). In addition to Wigglesworthia, tsetse harbors a secondary (S)-symbiont in midgut tissue. The specific function(s) of Wigglesworthia and S-symbionts are not known; however, since the ability to reproduce can be partially restored when the aposymbiotic tsetse receive a blood meal that is supplemented with B-complex vitamins (thiamine, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, folic acid, and biotin), it is suggested that the gut-tissue associated endosymbionts may play a role in metabolism that involves these compounds (Nogge, 1981). The recently sequenced genome of Wigglesworthia shows the presence of various biosynthetic pathways for vitamin metabolites (Akman et al., 2002). The 16S rDNA-based phylogeny of Wigglesworthia characterized from eight different tsetse species displays concordance with their insect host species, indicating an ancient association for this bacterium with an ancestral tsetse that has subsequently radiated along with the host insect species (Chen et al., 1999b). The bacterium is not present in the ovaries, but may be transmitted to the intrauterine larvae of tsetse via its milk-gland secretions.

Phase shift occurs to varying degrees in stationary phase cultures, giving rise to phase II, which lacks dye adsorption, antibiotic production, protein inclusions, and some other characteristics of the phase I isolated from the natural environment. Only known from the intestinal lumen of entomopathogenic nematodes of the family Steinernematidae and insects infected by these nematodes.

They live in close natural association with arthropod and vertebrate hosts. The genus includes Coxiella burnetii—the agent of Q fever—and endosymbionts of ticks and aquatic invertebrates. C. burnetii grows well in cultured cell lines and in the yolk sac of chicken embryos, where it undergoes a cycle of development with formation of an endospore-like body. Coxiella burnetii possesses two antigenic phases: natural virulent phase I and attenuated phase II, which is obtained after passage in cultured cell lines and yolk sac. The organism grows in vacuoles of the host cell rather than in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. C. burnetii phase I vacuoles share characteristics of late-stage, immature phagosomes whereas C. burnetii phase II vacuoles are bactericidal phagolysosomes. Highly resistant to chemical agents and elevated temperature. Coxiellae occur worldwide in ticks and various vertebrates, including humans.

Cells commonly occur in pairs and in chains of variable length. Do not form spores. Gram negative but occasionally difficult to destain. Swimming motility does not occur but the cells display “twitching motility”, presumably because of the presence of fimbriae. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Most strains do not reduce nitrate to nitrite. Most strains grow between 20 and 37°C, having temperature optima of 33–35°C. Some strains cannot grow at 37°C. Oxidase negative. Catalase positive. Grow well on most complex media. Most strains grow in defined media containing a single carbon and energy source, such as acetate or lactate, using ammonium or nitrate salts, or one of several common amino acids, as a supply of nitrogen.

Moraxella	Rods or cocci. The rods are often very short and plump, frequently approaching a coccus shape (1.0–1.5 × 1.5–2.5 µm); they usually occur in pairs and short chains (one plane of division). Variation in cell size, shape, and filament or chain formation is often seen in cultures, the pleomorphism being enhanced by lack of oxygen and by incubation temperatures above the optimum. The cocci are usually smaller (0.6–1.0 µm in diameter) and occur as single cells or in pairs with the adjacent sides flattened (differing planes of division); division in two planes at right angles to each other sometimes results in the formation of tetrads. Gram negative, but often with a tendency to resist Gram decolorization. Flagella are absent. Both rod-shaped and coccal species may be fimbriated. Swimming motility is absent, but surface-bound “twitching motility” has been observed in some rod-shaped species. Aerobic, but some strains may grow weakly under anaerobic conditions.

No acid is produced from carbohydrates. Usually highly sensitive to penicillin. Parasitic on the mucous membranes of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Strains of the several species of this genus have been shown to be genetically closely related by transformation of the high-level streptomycin resistance marker (Bøvre and Hagen, 1981) as well as by transformation of nutritional markers (Juni et al., 1987, 1988; Juni, 1990). DNA–DNA hybridization studies have shown high relative interspecies binding ratios for DNAs from strains of the genus Moraxella (Tønjum et al., 1989). Species of Moraxella share 95% similarity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences.
Psychrobacter	Rods or cocci, 0.9–1.3 × 1.5–3.8 µm. Rods can vary in length from extremely short (coccobacilli) to relatively long. For some strains the rods tend to be somewhat swollen. Also observed to grow as cocci or coccobacilli. Nonpigmented. Colonies on heart infusion agar are usually cream-colored, smooth, and opaque. Gram negative; the stain frequently tends to be retained. Nonmotile, and aerobic. Most strains are psychrotrophic; they are able to grow at 5°C, have temperature optima near 20°C, and generally are unable to grow at 35–37°C. Strains able to grow well at 35–37°C usually cannot grow at 5°C. Grow well on most common complex media. Most strains can grow on a mineral-agar medium containing a single carbon and energy source and ammonium salts as the nitrogen source. Some strains form acid aerobically from D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, and L-rhamnose. They are halotolerant and grow in the presence of 6.5% or greater NaCl. Many strains are radiation resistant. Oxidase positive. Catalase positive. Many strains are competent for natural genetic transformation. Have been isolated from the open sea, the deep sea, sea ice, ornithogenic soils, skins and gills of fish, skins of poultry, various food products, irradiated foods, air contaminants, and from a variety of human sources.

Azomonas	Cells are 2.0 μm or more in diameter, of variable length and shape, although usually 2.5–3.5 μm in length and generally ellipsoidal- to rod-shaped. They cannot easily be distinguished from cells of Azotobacter. Cells may occur singly, in pairs, or in clumps. Motile by peritrichous, lophotrichous, or polar flagella. Gram negative, but sometimes Gram variable, depending on culture age. Cysts are not formed in aging cultures. All species fix atmospheric nitrogen under aerobic conditions. Alternative nitrogenases containing vanadium (nitrogenase-2) or iron (nitrogenase-3) only may be synthesized in Mo-deficient media. Cultures can grow both aerobically and microaerobically. Chemoorganotrophic. Sugars, alcohols, and organic acids are used as carbon sources. Ammonium salts and sometimes nitrate (A. insignis only) are used as nitrogen sources; amino acids are not used.

Azotobacter	Cells range from straight rods with rounded ends to more ellipsoidal or coccoid, depending on the culture medium and age. Cells are up to 2 μm or more in diameter and 4 μm in length. A. paspali cells are usually longer, 5–10 µm in length, and can be filamentous, up to 60 µm long. Cells are usually single but may occur in pairs, irregular clumps (especially with A. paspali), or, more rarely, in chains of varying length. Encystment occurs during late stationary phase at low frequency or at high frequency after culturing on butanol. Motile with peritrichous flagella or nonmotile. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Nitrogen is fixed under microaerobic conditions (2% oxygen), under full aerobiosis, or after adaptation in hyperbaric oxygen. N2 fixation uses Mo-, V-, or Fe-containing nitrogenase enzymes, depending on the environmental metal supply. Water-soluble and water-insoluble pigments are produced by some strains of all species. Growth is heterotrophic; sugars, alcohols, and salts of organic acids are used as carbon sources. Ammonium salts, nitrate, and urea are used as sources of fixed nitrogen. Very few amino acids are used, probably due to a general deficiency in amino acid transport. The minimum pH for growth in the presence of fixed nitrogen sources ranges from 4.8 to 6.0 with maximum pH 8.5. The optimum pH for diazotrophic growth is 7.0–7.5. Most isolates are from soil, but a few are from water. One species (A. paspali) has been isolated only from roots of the tropical grass Paspalum notatum.

Methylophaga	Rod-shaped cells 0.2 × 0.9–1.0 μm, occurring singly or in pairs. Motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Gram negative. Spores and other resting stages are not formed. Chemoheterotrophic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Restricted methylotroph, able to utilize only a limited range of substrates, mostly C1 substrates including methanol, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine. The only C2+ compounds used for growth are D-fructose and sucrose. The ribulose monophosphate pathway is used for assimilation of C1 compounds. One species can utilize dimethylsulfide and grow mixotrophically by oxidizing H2S to thiosulfate. Catalase and oxidase positive. Na+ and Mg 2+are required for optimum growth. Requires vitamin B12 for growth. Major fatty acids are C16:0 and C16:1 ω7c. The major coenzyme Q is ubiquinone-8 (Q-8). Belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria. Isolated from seawater, brackish waters and marine benthic mats.
Piscirickettsia	Pleomorphic, but predominantly coccoid organisms, ~0.5–1.5 μm in diameter. Gram negative, Gimenez negative, and stain dark blue with Giemsa's stain. Nonmotile. Aerobic. Characteristically replicate within cytoplasmic vacuoles in susceptible fish host cells. Cultivable in fish cell cultures but not on any known host-cell-free medium. Direct host-to-host transmission occurs in the aquatic environment without the requirement of a vector. The 16S rRNA gene sequence conforms to the secondary structural models for the Gammaproteobacteria. No signature sequence has been identified. The etiological agent of the disease piscirickettsiosis in fishes.
Thioalkalimicrobium	Motile Gram-negative rods, curved rods, or spirilla (0.4–0.5 × 0.8–1.5 µm). 1–3 monopolar flagella. Possess carboxysomes. Chemolithoautotrophs; obligate aerobes. Oxidize sulfide and thiosulfate to sulfate; do not oxidize sulfite. Carbon assimilation via Calvin cycle. Halotolerant up to 1.2–1.5 M Na+; require at least 0.2–0.3 M NaCl.
Thiomicrospira	Small spiral-, comma-, or rod-shaped cells (0.2–0.5 × 0.8–3.0 µm) that occur singly. Gram negative. Motile by means of a polar flagellum or nonmotile. No resting stages are known. Aerobic. Chemolithoautotrophic, using reduced inorganic sulfur compounds, such as S0, sulfide, tetrathionate, thiosulfate (but not sulfite or thiocyanate), and CO2 as carbon source. CO2 is fixed via the Calvin-Benson cycle (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase is present). The final oxidation product is sulfate, but S0 may accumulate in the medium. During growth acid is produced. Ammonium salts serve as nitrogen source. Na+ ions are required for growth. The temperature optimum lies between 28°C and 40°C. The optimal pH varies from 6.0 to 8.0. Metabolic properties are very similar to those of the genus Thiobacillus.
Achromatium	Spherical to ovoid or cylindrical unicells with hemispherical ends. In natural populations, cells of widely different sizes appear. Cells vary in size from spheres of about 10 µm in diameter to giant cylindrical forms up to 30 × 125 µm (extremes are dividing stages); cells are on average 15 × 50 μm. Many size classes may be present within a sample. However, genetically different sub-populations that overlap in their dimensions can occur in a single habitat. Division of cells by binary constriction. Gram negative. Calcium carbonate (calcite) is deposited intracellularly. Additionally, the cells contain globules of S0.
Beggiatoa	Colorless cells, ~1.0–200 × 2.0–10.0 μm, occurring in filaments 5.0–10 cm in length. Filaments usually have a consistent width over the entire length. Freshwater strains mostly, if not universally, possess filament diameters less than 5.0 µm, whereas marine beggiatoas with filament diameters ranging from 1.0 to 200 µm have been observed microscopically. No strain wider than 5 µm has been isolated in axenic culture from any source. The filaments may contain up to 100 or more cells, and in rare cases, up to several thousand. Cells in filaments are cylindrical and are longer than they are wide in the thinner strains (i.e., those less than ~5 µm in diameter). In wider strains (i.e., those greater than ~7 µm in diameter), cells are usually disk-shaped and typically are wider than they are long. Filaments occur singly, in sheets of cottony masses on sediment surfaces, or in mats in which each filament retains its individuality. Reproduction is by transverse binary fission of cells within filaments; division occurs by septation, in which the peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membranes close like the iris of a diaphragm. Filament dispersion is via sacrificial cell death (necridial cells), filament breakage, or simple disintegration. In some strains, the disintegration of filaments occurs until mostly single or double cell units (hormogonia) exist; a hormogonium then can grow to become a filament. Cells contain inclusions of sulfur when grown in the presence of H2S and, for some strains, thiosulfate. Intracellular inclusions of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate or polyphosphate may be present, particularly in freshwater strains. Marine or brackish water strains having a filament diameter of >10 μm contain a large (~80% of the cell volume), central liquid vacuole that contains concentrated nitrate. Resting stages are not known. Attachment holdfasts or sheaths are not present. Capsules are not formed, but filaments usually produce a slime matrix. Gram negative. Filaments and hormogonia have gliding motility. No motility organelles are known. Aerobic or microaerophilic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism, with oxygen and, in some instance, nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Anaerobic growth is not proven with pure cultures, but may occur with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor for some strains studied in nature. Internally stored sulfur may also serve as an electron acceptor by freshwater strains for short-term maintenance in the absence of oxygen. Sulfate does not substitute as the terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic growth in strains thus far studied. Chemoorganotrophic (freshwater strains), and either facultatively or constitutively chemolithoautotrophic (marine strains). H2S or thiosulfate may be used as the electron donor for chemolithotrophic metabolism. Acetate is oxidized to CO2 by all freshwater strains tested thus far. Several C2, C3, and C4 organic acids and, sometimes, their amino acid equivalents are utilized as sole carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic growth. Growth factors are not required by most strains, although some strains may require vitamin B12. Gelatin and starch are not hydrolyzed. N2 is fixed by all freshwater and marine strains tested thus far. Nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, N2, or certain amino acids may be used as the sole nitrogen source. Oxidase positive. Catalase negative. Freshwater, estuarine, and marine strains are known. Beggiatoas are inherently gradient organisms, growing in horizontal layers in sediments at the interface between the underlying anoxic sulfide-liberating zone and the overlying oxic zone. Growth can occur in the range of 0–40°C. Obligately thermophilic strains have not been characterized, although some beggiatoas have been observed in high temperature runoffs associated with thermal springs, or in mats adjacent to thermal vents in the ocean floor.
Leucothrix	Long filaments composed of short, cylindrical or ovoid cells (gonidia), cross-walls clearly visible, colorless, unbranched; typically uniform filaments may taper from base to apex, showing under some conditions an apical beady chain of gonidia connected from end to end. Filaments may attain a length of over 100 µm, and lengths of several hundred micrometers are not unusual (Harold and Stanier, 1955; Pringsheim, 1957). The filaments, particularly when attached to a substrate, may be somewhat tapered, with the apex being 2–3 µm and the base 5–6 µm in diameter (Harold and Stanier, 1955; Pringsheim, 1957; Brock, 1969). In nature, filaments are usually attached to solid substrates by means of inconspicuous holdfasts; stalks and sheaths absent. Filaments do not glide, but may wave sporadically from side to side. Dispersal by means of gonidia (single cells arising from cells of the filaments by rounding up, often released primarily from apices, but they may also be formed in an intercalary fashion); gonidia often, but not always, show jerky gliding motion on solid substrates. Rosette formation is a key diagnostic characteristic of the genus that is seen frequently in laboratory culture but less commonly in nature. The rosettes may be formed of gonidia or, after gonidial growth, of several or more filaments attached at their bases. Filaments in a laboratory culture often form true knots. These structures also occur in nature, but rarely. The organism morphologically resembles some filamentous cyanobacteria but does not form photosynthetic pigments. Gram negative. Strictly aerobic, heterotrophic. Aquatic; typically marine, although one freshwater strain has been reported. Strains require NaCl for growth; optimum concentration: about 1.5% NaCl; grows at concentrations of 0.3–6.0% NaCl. Most strains do not require growth factors. Optimum temperature: 25°C; maximum: 30–35°C; minimum: 0°C, forming visible colonies within 1–2 weeks. Strains from tropical waters are more stenothermal, not growing below 15°C. Catalase positive. Oxidase positive.
Thiobacterium	Rod-shaped cells, each containing one or more sulfur globules. Cells embedded in gelatinous masses, which are spherical when free-floating or are dendroid when attached to a solid substrate. Nonmotile. No resting stages known. Has not been grown in pure culture.
Thiomargarita	Very large spherical cells held together like a string of pearls by a common gelatinous mucus. The cells are not joined to each other, which is the main difference to the closely related filamentous genera, Thioploca and Beggiatoa. Numerous sulfur inclusions occur in a thin outer layer of cytoplasm. The cells appear hollow due to a large central vacuole in which nitrate is stored. Most strings of cells are linear and typically contain 20–60 cells, but some are branched or coiled. Both single cells and strings of more than 100 cells occur. Nonmotile. Gram negative. Oxygen tolerant. Thiomargarita appear to have an autotrophic or mixotrophic, sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing metabolism, comparable to the large marine forms of Thioploca and Beggiatoa, which are its closest relatives according to partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
Thioploca	Flexible, uniseriate, colorless filaments made up of numerous cells and enclosed by a common gelatinous sheath. Gram negative. Cells are disk-shaped or cylindrical, generally harbor sulfur inclusions in their cytoplasm, and are separated by distinct cross-walls. Cells of large marine Thioploca species appear hollow due to central vacuoles in which nitrate is stored. Individual filaments are of uniform diameter, often with tapered terminal cells. Filaments fall into distinct classes of different diameters, which represent different species. Filaments show independent gliding movement within a sheath. They can emerge from the end or from breaks in the sheath and may be found outside sheaths. Chemotactic. May be attracted by nitrate but avoid high oxygen and sulfide concentrations. Thioploca sheaths are mostly vertically orientated to allow the filaments to move between spatially separated pools of electron donor (sulfide) and acceptor (nitrate, possibly oxygen). The sheath surrounding several filaments is the main feature distinguishing the genus Thioploca from the similar, closely related genus Beggiatoa. Not in pure culture. Large, marine Thioploca species have an autotrophic or mixotrophic, sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing metabolism. By 16S rRNA, Thioploca is a member of the Gammaproteobacteria and is the closest relative of the genera Beggiatoa and Thiomargarita .
Thiospira	Spirilla, usually with pointed ends, containing sulfur inclusions. Motile by monotrichous or polytrichous polar flagella. No resting stages known. Isolates conforming to the descriptions of the two “species” have now been obtained (Dubinina et al., 1993).
Thiothrix	Rods, 0.7–1.5 × 1.2–2.5 µm, depending on species, seriate in rigid, multicellular filaments (trichomes) of uniform (as long as 500 µm) or slightly tapering (base to tip and typically ranging from 100–200 µm in length with shorter trichomes present in agitated as opposed to static cultures) diameter. Gram negative or Gram variable. Capsules not produced. Trichomes clearly ensheathed in some but not all species. False branching never observed. Rod-shaped gonidia with rounded ends formed at the apical region of the trichome. Gonidia motile by gliding. The base of the trichome may have a holdfast. Rosettes of trichomes typically but not always produced. Only rosette-forming strains produce gonidia. Resting stages not known. Flagella absent, but a tuft of monopolar fimbriae may be present.
Frateuria	Regular straight rods, 0.5–0.7 × 0.7–3.5 µm, occurring singly or in pairs. Gram negative. Generally motile by polar flagella or nonmotile. Obligately aerobic. Optimum temperature for growth 25–30°C. Colonies on mannitol–yeast extract–peptone (MYP) agar1 are yellow to orange. On glucose–yeast extract–CaCO3 (GYC) agar,2 most strains produce a typical brown water-soluble pigment. Oxidase negative. Grows at pH 3.6. No nitrate reduction. Starch and gelatin are not hydrolyzed. H2S is produced. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is produced from ethanol and a number of carbon sources. On D-glucose and D-xylose, the pH drops below 4.0. From D-glucose, 2-keto-, and 2,5-diketogluconic acids are formed, but not 5-ketogluconic acid. No requirements for growth factors. Isolated from Lilium auratum and from the fruit of Rubus parvifolius (raspberry) in Japan.
Luteimonas	Rod-shaped cells 0.4–0.6 × 0.8–1.8 µm. Gram negative. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Nitrite is reduced to nitrous oxide, but nitrate is not reduced. Colonies are yellow. Heterotrophic. Ubiquinone with eight isoprene units. Iso-/anteiso-type fatty acid profile with C15:0 iso and C17:1 iso 9c predominating. Isolated from several experimental biofilters supplied with the waste gas of an animal rendering plant.
Lysobacter	Thin rods, 0.2–0.5 × 1.0–15 (sometimes up to 70) µm, which are Gram negative, nonflagellated, gliding, flexing, and aerobic. Colonies are highly mucoid, cream-colored, pink, or yellow-brown; many strains also produce a brown, water-soluble pigment. Nonfruiting; no microcysts produced. Growth in broth culture is silky. Most strains are resistant to actinomycin D. This organism degrades chitin and often other polysaccharides, but it does not degrade filter-paper cellulose, and it infrequently degrades agar. Strongly proteolytic, characteristically lysing a variety of microorganisms (both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including actinomycetes, blue-green and green algae, yeasts, and filamentous fungi), as well as nematodes. Habitat: soil and freshwater.
Nevskia	Cells elongated, rod shaped, usually slightly bent with acellular hyaline stalks (Figure 1). The stalks branch dichotomously because of binary fission of mature cells and the preference for laterally excreted slime material (Figure 2). Undisturbed and slowly growing cells form flat, rosette-like to bush-like microcolonies (Figure 3), up to 80 µm in diameter, on the surface of freshwater. Faster growth results in the formation of a thin surface pellicle without distinct stalks (Figure 4) and with slime all around the cells. Cells filled with numerous refractile globules (Figure 4) which consist mainly of polyhydroxyalkanoates. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative. In young cultures, some cells are motile by means of a polar flagellum: they are set free from the microcolonies and can start the development of new colonies (Figure 5). Strictly aerobic. Optimum growth temperature: 20–25°C. Chemoorganotrophic, with a broad range of organic compounds, having an oxidative type of metabolism. Colorless colonies on nutrient agar. Weak catalase activity, no cytochrome oxidase activity. Cytochromes of the b and c types are present. Originally found in the surface pellicle of an aquarium. Occur mainly on the surface of freshwater environments (neuston community).
Pseudoxanthomonas	Rod-shaped cells. Gram negative. Aerobic. Heterotrophic. Colonies are yellow. Possess a ubiquinone with eight isoprene units. The predominant fatty acids in the iso-/anteiso-type fatty acid profile are C 15:0 iso and C15:0 anteiso .
Rhodanobacter	Gram-negative rods. Nonmotile. Colonies on SMA agar plates are yellow with clean edges, 0.2–1 mm in diameter after 3 d at 30°C. Do not form spores. Branching does not occur. Aerobic; chemoorganotrophic. Catalase and oxidase positive. Optimum growth temperature 30°C. Based on analysis of 16S rDNA sequences, Rhodanobacter belongs in the class Gammaproteobacteria, order Xanthomonadales, and family Xanthomonadaceae.
Schineria	Gram-negative nonmotile aerobic rods. Catalase positive. Major fatty acids, C14:0, C16:0, and C18:1. Major polar lipids include phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine.
Stenotrophomonas	Straight or curved rods but not helical, 0.5 × 1.5 µm, occur singly or in pairs. Do not accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules as intracellular reserve material. No resting stages are known. Gram negative. Motile by two or more polar flagella. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as electron acceptor. Nitrate is reduced but it is not used as a nitrogen source for growth. The colonies are yellow, greenish, or gray. The yellow color is not due to carotenoids or xanthomonadins. The colonies may turn a dark brown color with age. The major polyamines are spermidine and cadaverine. Aside from fatty acids in common with Xanthomonas species, one of the species (S. maltophilia) is characterized by the presence of C 17:0 cyclopropane fatty acid and ubiquinone Q8. No growth occurs at 4 or 41°C; the optimum growth temperature is ~35°C. Oxidase negative. Gelatinase and catalase positive. Strong lipolytic activity, as judged by the hydrolysis of Tween 80. Chemoorganotrophic. One of the species (S. maltophilia) is widely distributed in nature and is commonly isolated from clinical materials and nosocomial infections.
Thermomonas	Gram-negative filamentous rods (1.0–12.5 × 0.5–0.75 µm). Motile by means of polar monotrichous flagellation or nonmotile. Aerobic. Endospores are not formed. Moderately thermophilic; temperature range for growth is 18–50°C, with an optimum between 37 and 50°C. Catalase and oxidase positive. Chemoorganotrophic. Carbohydrates are usually not utilized. Indole, Voges–Proskauer, methyl red, and Simmons citrate tests are negative. Urea is hydrolyzed. Nitrate is not reduced to nitrite or nitrogen; H2S is not produced. Ubiquinone Q-8 is the major respiratory lipoquinone system. The main component in the cellular polyamine content is spermidine. Polar lipid fingerprints are characterized by the presence of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol. Cellular fatty acids are predominantly iso-branched with C15:0 iso and C16:0 iso as major components; other characteristic fatty acids are C11:0 iso, C11:0 iso 3OH, and C17:1 iso ω9c. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data, Thermomonas haemolytica currently forms a separate line of descent within the Xanthomonadaceae related to the genera Xanthomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Luteimonas, Stenotrophomonas , and Xylella .
Xanthomonas	Straight rods, 0.4–0.6 × 0.8–2.0 μm, mostly single or in pairs, occasionally short chains, filaments rarely seen. Gram negative. Do not produce poly-β-hydroxybutyrate inclusions, nor have sheaths, prosthecae, or resting stages. Motile by a single polar flagellum. Obligately aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. No denitrification or nitrate reduction occurs. Colonies are usually yellow, smooth and butyrous, mucoid or viscid. The pigments are highly characteristic brominated aryl polyenes or “xanthomonadins”. A characteristic extracellular acidic heteropolysaccharide called xanthan is produced by most strains giving the viscous consistency. Growth is inhibited by 6% NaCl, 30% glucose, 0.01% lead acetate, methyl green, or thionin, and by 0.1% (and usually by 0.02%) triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. Catalase positive; oxidase negative or weak; urease not produced. H2S is usually produced, but not indole or acetoin. Acid is not produced in litmus milk or purple milk. Chemoorganotrophic; able to use various carbohydrates and salts of organic acids as sole carbon sources. Small amounts of acid are produced from many carbohydrates, but not from l-rhamnose, adonitol, sorbose, d-sorbitol, meso-inositol, or meso-erythritol. Metabolic activity is shown in Biolog GN microplate tests with d-fructose, d-glucose, d-mannose and methylpyruvate, but not with α-cyclodextrin, adonitol, D-arabitol, meso-erythritol, meso-inositol, xylitol, D-glucosaminate, γ-hydroxybutyrate, itaconate, sebacate, L-ornithine, L-pyroglutamate, D-serine, D,L-carnitine, γ-aminobutyrate, phenylethylamine, putrescine, 2-aminoethanol, or 2,3-butanediol. L-asparagine, L-glutamine, and glycine cannot be used as sole sources of both carbon and nitrogen. Among the nine fatty acids that predominate in whole cell preparations are 9-methyl decanoic acid (C11:0 iso), 3-hydroxy-9-methyl decanoic acid (C11:0 iso 3OH), and 3-hydroxy-11-methyl dodecanoic acid (C13:0 iso 3OH), which are highly characteristic of this genus. The ubiquinone that is present has eight isoprene units. Spermidine is the main polyamine; spermine is usually detectable, but not 2-hydroxyputrescine or 1,3-diaminopropane. Species so far described are plant pathogens or are plant associated.
Xylella	Single, straight rods, 0.25–0.35 × 0.9–3.5 μm, that can form long filamentous strands under some cultural conditions. Gram negative. Nonmotile, lacking flagella. Endospores not produced. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Colonies are cream to white. Two colonial variants are frequently encountered: convex to pulvinate, smooth, opalescent with entire margins; and umbonate, rough with finely undulated margins. Oxidase negative and catalase positive. Optimum temperature for growth, 26–28°C; optimum pH for growth, 6.5–6.9. Nutritionally fastidious. Found mainly in the xylem of plant tissue.
Brachyspira	Brachyspira spirochetes are helical shaped bacteria with regular coiling patterns. Cells measure 2–11 µm by 0.2–0.4 µm. Unicellular, but dividing pairs and occasional chains of three or more cells can be observed in growing cultures. Under unfavorable growth conditions, spherical or round bodies are formed. Gram-stain negative. Obligately anaerobic, aerotolerant. Cell ends may be blunt or pointed. Cells have a typical spirochete cell ultrastructure, consisting of an outer sheath, helical protoplasmic cylinder, and internal flagella in the space between the protoplasmic cylinder and outer sheath. Brachyspire cells have 8–30 flagella per cell depending on the species (flagellar number usually correlates with cell size and species of smaller cells have fewer flagella). Flagella attach subterminally in equal numbers at each cell end, wrap around the protoplasmic cylinder, and their free ends overlap in the middle of the cells. Flexing and creeping motility at 22°C; translational movement in liquids at 37–42°C. Cultured anaerobically on commercially available media (trypticase soy or brain heart infusion broths) containing a carbohydrate growth substrate and supplemented with defibrinated blood or animal (calf) serum. Grows at 36–42°C, optimally at 37–39°C. Population doubling times on glucose in broth cultures are 1–5 h (not reported for Brachyspira aalborgi). Chemoorganotrophic, using various carbohydrates for growth. Possess NADH oxidase for reducing molecular oxygen. Consume oxygen during growth in culture broth beneath a 1% oxygen atmosphere. Acetate, butyrate, H2, and CO2 are major endproducts of glucose metabolism. Higher amounts of H2 than CO2 are produced. Weakly hemolytic except for Brachyspira hyodysenteriae which exhibits β-hemolysis (strongly hemolytic). Associated with animal and human hosts. Some species are pathogenic. The genus Brachyspira is distinguished from other spirochete genera based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Brachyspira species share high 16S rRNA sequence similarity with each other. Species can be differentiated by DNA–DNA relative reassociation and MLEE (multilocus enzyme electrophoresis) analyses. Similar to other spirochete genera, Brachyspira is insensitive to the antibiotic rifampin.
Brevinema	Helical cells are 0.2–0.3 μm in diameter by 4–5 μm in length, displaying one to two helical turns. Irregular wavelengths of the cells range from 2 to 3 µm. Sheathed periplasmic flagella are in a 1:2:1 arrangement. No cytoplasmic tubules have been observed. Cells are motile by flexing, rotation, and translation. Microaerophilic, host-associated, isolated from blood and other tissues of short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Infectious for laboratory mice and Syrian hamsters.
Leptonema	Long, thin, flexible rods, 0.1–0.2 μm in diameter and 13–21 μm in length, with a regular helical coiling pattern having a wavelength of 0.6–0.7 µm. Unicellular but may be observed as dividing pairs or short chains in actively growing cultures. Resting stages are not known. Gram-stain-negative. Due to small diameter, unstained cells are not visible by bright-field microscopy. Dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy is required for visualization of unstained cells. Highly motile. Obligate aerobes. Growth temperatures range between 13 and 30°C, with optimal growth at 28–30°C. Chemoorganotrophic; consume long-chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols as primary carbon and energy sources. Can grow on trypticase media. Uses respiration with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Optimal growth occurs in semi-solid (0.2%) agar media. Growth on 1–2% solid agar results in the formation of clear to turbid subsurface colonies. Oxidase-positive. Lipase-positive. Nonpathogenic for cattle, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, and mice. Free-living in aquatic environments and soil. Some strains found in association with animals. Does not share significant levels of sequence similarity with other Leptospiraceae as determined by DNA hybridization analysis. The 16S rRNA sequence is distinct from other Leptospiraceae.
Leptospira	Leptospira are long, thin, flexible rods, 0.1 μm in diameter and 6–12 μm in length, with a regular right-handed helical coiling pattern (Carleton et al., 1979). These bacteria are unicellular but may be observed as dividing pairs or short chains of three or more cells in actively growing cultures. Resting stages are not known, but long term survival in water, with the appearance of aggregates has been described (Trueba et al., 2004). Spherically shaped cells form under unfavorable growth conditions. Bacteria stain as Gram-negative. Due to the small diameter of these bacteria, unstained cells are not visible by bright-field microscopy. Dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy is required for visualization of unstained cells. These are highly motile aerobic or microaerophilic bacteria. Optimum growth temperature is 28–30°C, with a generation time of 6–16 h, although many primary pathogenic isolates may grow slower. Chemoorganotrophic bacteria that consume long-chain fatty acids and alcohols as primary carbon and energy sources, and carry out respiration with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Optimal growth occurs in semi-solid (0.1–0.2%) agar media. Growth on 1–2% solid agar results in the formation of clear to turbid surface or subsurface colonies. Colony formation is enhanced by the addition of pyruvate. Oxidase, catalase, and/or peroxidase-positive. Some strains are β-hemolytic. Some strains are pathogenic for humans and animals, while other strains are saprophytic and found in freshwater and marine environments. The genus Leptospira forms a deep unique branch of spirochetes, separate from other genera based on comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Species are differentiated by DNA–DNA relative reassociation analysis and by unique sequence polymorphisms in 16S rRNA.
Turneriella	Flexible helical rods, 0.3 × 3.5–7.5 μm with a wavelength of 0.3–0.5 μm. Gram-stain-negative. Unicellular. Resting stages are not known. Dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy is required for visualization of unstained cells. Obligate aerobes. Grows slowly at 13, 30, and 37°C, with temperature optimum of 28–30°C. Chemoorganotrophic bacteria that consume long-chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols as primary carbon and energy sources. Optimal growth occurs in semi-solid (0.2%) agar media. Oxidase-positive. Lipase-positive. Isolated from contaminated culture medium, tap water, and uterus of a sow. DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequence analyzes show this genus is distinct from other Leptospiraceae.
Borrelia	Helical cells are 0.2–0.5 mm by 3–30 mm, composed of 3–10 loose coils. The cells are surrounded by a surface layer, an outer membrane, periplasmic flagella, and a protoplasmic cylinder (Figure 1). Typically, 15–20 periplasmic flagella (which also have been termed endoflagella, axial fibrils, or periplasmic fibrils) originate at each end of the cell and wind about the protoplasmic cylinder to overlap in the middle of the cell. The protoplasmic cylinder consists of a peptidoglycan layer and an inner membrane which encloses the internal components of the cells. The cells are actively motile with frequent reversal of the direction of translational movement. Gram-stain-negative. Stain well with Giemsa stain. Species which have been grown in vitro are microaerophilic. Nutritional requirements for in vitro growth are complex. Arthropod-borne pathogens of man, other mammals, and birds. The causative agents of tick-borne Lyme disease and relapsing fever and louse-borne relapsing fever in man.
Cristispira	Helical cells are 0.5–3.0 μm in diameter × 30–180 μm in length, displaying 2–10 helical turns. Ends of cells are blunt, rounded, or tapered. Round inclusions of unknown composition or function are seen in stained preparations or under phase microscopy. Multiple cytoplasmic vesicles bounded by a double membrane are observed in electron microscopy thin sections. Cells divide by transverse fission. Hundreds of periplasmic flagella are bundled together and wrap around the protoplasmic cylinder forming a ridge or crest (called crista). The cristae can be clearly seen under light microscopy when the cells stop moving. Cells flex, rotate, and swim rapidly at more than 100 μm/s. Under adverse environments, cells stop moving and form spherical bodies or lyse. Found in the crystalline style of the digestive tract of marine and freshwater mollusks. Not known to be pathogenic and probably represent normal microflora. Cristispira-like cells have also been observed in gastropods, e.g., snails, and in nonmollusk species. Cristispira has not yet been grown in pure culture.
Spirochaeta	Flexible helical cells 0.2–0.75 μm in diameter and 5–250 μm in length. All species have two periplasmic flagella per cell except Spirochaeta plicatilis, which has many periplasmic flagella. Under unfavorable conditions, spherical cells or structures 0.5–2.0 µm (occasionally up to 10 µm) in diameter are formed. Cells translocate when suspended in liquids and crawl or creep when in contact with solid surfaces. Obligately anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic. Under aerobic growth conditions the facultatively anaerobic species usually produce carotenoid pigments that give a yellow, yellow-orange, or red coloration to colonies or cells in liquid media. Thermophilic species are known. Optimum temperature range, 25–68°C. Chemo-organotrophic, using a variety of carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources. The main products of anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism are ethanol, acetate, CO2, and H2. Under aerobic conditions, facultatively anaerobic species oxidize carbohydrates yielding primarily CO2 and acetate. Indigenous to aquatic freshwater and marine environments such as the sediments, mud and water of ponds, marshes, swamps, lakes, rivers, and hot springs. Occur commonly in H2S-containing environments. Free-living. None reported to be pathogenic.
Treponema	Host-associated, helical cells 0.1–0.7 μm in diameter and 1–20 μm in length. Cells have tight regular or irregular spirals and one or more periplasmic flagella (axial fibrils or axial filaments) inserted at each end of the protoplasmic cylinder. Cytoplasmic filaments are seen in the protoplasmic cylinder just under the cytoplasmic membrane and running parallel with the periplasmic flagella. Under unfavorable cultural or environmental conditions, spherical cells are formed. These can also be seen in old cultures. Gram-stain-negative. Cells stain well with silver impregnation methods. Most species stain poorly, if at all, with Gram or Giemsa stain. Best observed with darkfield or phase-contrast microscopy. Motile. Cells have rotational movement in liquid media, and translational motion in media with high viscosity [e.g., those containing 1% (w/v) methyl cellulose]. In a semisolid or solid medium, cells exhibit a serpentine type movement, sometimes referred to as creeping motility. Strictly anaerobic or microaerophilic. Frank pathogens (Treponema pallidum subspecies, Treponema carateum, and the rabbit pathogen Treponema paraluiscuniculi) represent a closely related subset within this genus and are considered microaerophiles. Limited multiplication of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum strains has been obtained in a tissue culture system, but none of the pathogenic Treponema have been cultivated continuously in artificial media or in tissue culture. Chemo-organotrophs, using a variety of carbohydrates or amino acids for carbon and energy sources. Cultivated anaerobic species are catalase- and oxidase-negative. Some require long-chain fatty acids found in serum for growth, while other cultivated species require short-chain volatile fatty acids for growth. Host-associated. Pathogenic Treponema pallidum subspecies cause skin lesions, and Treponema pallidum (particularly subspecies pallidum) can cause systemic infections that, if untreated, can last for years to decades. Other species are found in the oral cavity, intestinal tract, and genital areas of humans or other mammals, and in the gut contents of wood-feeding insects.
Synergistes	Gram-negative, nonmotile rods. Nonsporing, strictly anaerobic chemoorganotroph. Growth occurs in media that contain yeast extract plus any of a variety of peptones. Certain amino acids and/or pyridinediols are fermented and products formed from peptones include formate, acetate, propionate, H2, and ammonia. Carbohydrates are not fermented. The 16S rRNA is affiliated with the bacterial domain. No sequence similarities greater than ~84% were identified among near-full length 16S rRNA sequences in the 7.1 release of the RDP (Maidak et al., 1999) or GenBank (as of March 2000). The 16S rDNA is most closely related (80–83% sequence similarity) to two recently described amino acid fermenters, Aminomonas paucivorans and Thermoanaerovibrio acidaminovorans, and also demonstrates a distant relationship to Dethiosulfovibrio peptidovorans by both maximum likelihood (Figure 1) and neighbor-joining analysis. The only known habitat is the rumen but other gastrointestinal habitats are likely.
Aminomonas	Cells are strictly anaerobic, nonsporeforming, nonmotile, slightly curved rods, occurring singly or in pairs. Gram-stain-negative. Mesophilic, neutrophilic. Optimum growth at 35°C and pH 7.5 on arginine with a generation time of 16 h. Heterotrophic. Good growth on arginine, histidine, threonine, and glycine. Acetate is the end product formed from all these substrates; in addition, trace amount of formate is detected from arginine and histidine. Ornithine is produced from arginine. Slow growth on glutamate with production of acetate, carbon dioxide, formate, hydrogen, and traces of propionate as the end products. In syntrophic association with Methanobacterium formicicum, methane is produced from arginine, histidine, and glutamate which are oxidized into propionate as the major product together with acetate and carbon dioxide. Alanine and the branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine are not degraded either in pure culture or in association with Methanobacterium formicicum.
Thermanaerovibrio	Cells are curved rods. Cell wall has Gram-negative structure. Motile by means of lateral flagella located on the concave side of the cells. Nonsporeforming. Obligate anaerobe. Neutrophilic. Thermophilic. Chemo-organotrophic; grows fermentatively with some amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates as substrates, or lithoheterotrophically with molecular hydrogen and elemental sulfur.
Aminobacterium	Cells are strictly anaerobic, nonsporeforming, nonmotile or motile by means of one or two lateral flagella, slightly curved rods, occurring singly, in pairs, or, rarely, as chains. Gram-stain-negative. Mesophilic, neutrophilic. Heterotrophic, asaccharolytic. Growth by fermentation of a limited range of amino acids only in the presence of yeast extract.

In complex media, cells may or may not grow with sheathlike material that extends past the cell poles. Endospores have not been observed. Cells stain Gram-negative. Ferment organic acids, protein extracts, and a limited range of carbohydrates. Sulfur, thiosulfate, and cystine are reduced to hydrogen sulfide. Sulfate, sulfite, and nitrate are not reduced. Isolated from production waters of a petroleum reservoir and an anaerobic lagoon treating wool-scouring wastewater.
Dethiosulfovibrio	Vibrios or curved rods. Strictly anaerobic heterotrophs that ferment peptides and amino acids. Sugars are not utilized.

Endospores are not formed. Motile by means of lateral flagella. Isolated from the production water of oilfields and “Thiodendron” mats in consortia with spirochetes.
Acholeplasma	Cells are spherical, with a diameter of about 300 nm, or filamentous, 2–5 µm long. Nonmotile. Colonies have a “fried-egg” appearance and may reach 2–3 mm in diameter. Facultatively anaerobic; most strains grow readily in simple media. All members lack a sterol requirement for growth. Chemo-organotrophic, most species utilizing glucose and other sugars as the major energy sources. Many strains are capable of fatty acid biosynthesis from acetate. Arginine and urea are not hydrolyzed. Pigmented carotenoids occur in some species. All species are resistant, or only slightly susceptible, to 1.5% digitonin. Saprophytes found in soil, compost, wastewaters, or commensals of vertebrates, insects, or plants. None are known to be a primary pathogen, but they may cause cytopathic effects in tissue cultures. The genome sizes range from about 1500 to 2100 kbp. All species examined utilize the universal genetic code in which UGA is a stop codon.
Anaeroplasma	Cells are predominantly coccoid, about 500 nm in diameter; clusters of up to ten coccoid cells may be joined by short filaments. Older cells have a variety of pleomorphic forms. Cells lack a cell wall and are bound by a single plasma membrane. Gram-stain-negative due to absence of cell wall. Obligately anaerobic; the inhibitory effect of oxygen on growth is not alleviated during repeated subcultures. Require sterol supplements for growth. Nonmotile. Optimal temperature, 37°C; no growth at 26 or 47°C. Optimal pH, 6.5–7.0. Surface colonies have a dense center with a translucent periphery, or “fried-egg” appearance. Subsurface colonies are golden, irregular, and often multilobed. Strains vary in their ability to ferment various carbohydrates. The products of carbohydrate fermentation include acids (generally acetic, formic, propionic, lactic, and succinic), ethanol, and gases (primarily CO2, but some strains also produce H2). Bacteriolytic and nonbacteriolytic strains have been described. Commensals in the bovine and ovine rumen.
Asteroleplasma	Cellular and colonial morphology similar to species of the genus Anaeroplasma. Nonmotile. The three strains that form the new genus and species are obligately anaerobic and capable of growth in the absence of cholesterol or serum supplements. Temperature optimum for growth is 37°C. No evidence of bacteriolytic activity. The organisms are serologically distinct from other members in the family Anaeroplasmataceae. Occur in the ovine rumen.
“Candidatus Phytoplasma”	Phytoplasmas (Sears and Kirkpatrick, 1994) are wall-less, nutritionally fastidious, phytopathogenic prokaryotes 0.2–0.8 µm in diameter that morphologically resemble members of the Mollicutes. Sequencing of nearly full-length PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes (Gundersen et al., 1994; Namba et al., 1993; Seemüller et al., 1994), combined with earlier studies (Kuske and Kirkpatrick, 1992b; Lim and Sears, 1989), provided the first comprehensive phylogeny of the organisms and showed that they constitute a unique, monophyletic clade within the Mollicutes. These organisms are most closely related to members of the genus Acholeplasma within the Anaeroplasma clade as defined by Weisburg et al. (1989). Sustained culture in cell-free media has not yet been demonstrated for any phytoplasma. Their genome sizes have been estimated to range from 530 to 1350 kb, and the G+C content of phytoplasma DNA is about 23–30 mol%. The presence of a characteristic oligonucleotide sequence in the 16S rRNA gene, CAA GAY BAT KAT GTK TAG CYG GDC T, and standard codon usage indicate that phytoplasmas represent a distinct taxon for which the name “Candidatus Phytoplasma” has been adopted by specialists in the molecular biology and pathogenicity of these and similar phytopathogenic organisms (IRPCM Phytoplasma/Spiroplasma Working Team – Phytoplasma Taxonomy Group, 2004). At present, the designation “Candidatus” must still be used for new types.
Entomoplasma	Cells are nonhelical and nonmotile, frequently pleomorphic and range in size from 200 to 1200 nm in diameter. Some cells exhibit short filamentous forms. Most species ferment glucose. Species possess the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar-phosphotransferase system. Organisms require serum or cholesterol for growth. The temperature range for growth ranges from 10 to 32°C, with the optimum usually at 30–32°C. The genome sizes range from 870 to 900 kbp (PFGE). All currently assigned species were isolated from insects or from plant surfaces where they were presumably deposited by insects.
Mesoplasma	Cells are nonhelical and nonmotile, generally coccoid or short filamentous forms. Coccoid cells are usually 220–300 nm in diameter, but some cells in some species can be as large as 400–500 nm. Most strains ferment glucose and most, but not all, lack the ability to hydrolyze arginine. Species possess the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar-phosphotransferase system. Neither serum nor cholesterol is required for growth, but strains show sustained growth in a serum-free or cholesterol-free medium when the medium is supplemented with 0.04% PES. The optimum temperature for growth is usually near 28–32°C, with some strains able to grow well at temperatures as low as 23°C or as high as 37°C. Genome sizes range from 825 to 930 kbp (PFGE).
Spiroplasma	Cells are pleomorphic, varying in size and shape from helical and branched nonhelical filaments to spherical or ovoid. The helical forms, usually 100–200 nm in diameter and 3–5 µm in length, generally occur during the exponential phase of growth and in some species persist during stationary phase. The cells of some species are short (1–2 µm). In certain cases, helical cells may be very tightly coiled, or the coils may show continuous variation in amplitude. Spherical cells ~300 nm in diameter and nonhelical filaments are frequently seen in the stationary phase, where they may not be viable, and in all growth phases in suboptimal growth media, where they may or may not be viable. In some species during certain phases, spherical forms may be the replicating form. Helical filaments are motile, with flexional and twitching movements, and often show an apparent rotatory motility. Fibrils are associated with the membrane, but flagellae, periplasmic fibrils, or other organelles of locomotion are absent. Fimbriae and pili observed on the cell surface of insect- and plant-pathogenic spiroplasmas are believed to be involved in host-cell attachment and conjugation (Ammar et al., 2004; Özbek et al., 2003), but not in locomotion. Cells divide by binary fission, with doubling times of 0.7–37 h. Facultatively anaerobic. The temperature growth range varies among species, from 5 to 41°C. Colonies on solid media are frequently diffuse, with irregular shapes and borders, a condition that reflects the motility of the cells during active growth (Figure 111). Colony type is strongly dependent on the agar concentration. Colony sizes vary from 0.1 to 4.0 mm in diameter. Colonies formed by nonmotile variants or mutants, or by cultures growing on inadequate media are typically umbonate with diameters of 200 µm or less. Some species, such as Spiroplasma platyhelix, have barely visible helicity along most of their length and display little rotatory or flexing motility. Colonies of motile, fast-growing spiroplasmas are diffuse, often with satellite colonies developing from foci adjacent to the initial site of colony development. Light turbidity may be produced in liquid cultures. Chemo-organotrophic. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolysis of arginine is variable. Urea, arbutin, and esculin are not hydrolyzed. Sterol requirements are variable. An optimum osmolality, usually in the range of 300–800 mOsm, has been demonstrated for some spiroplasmas. Media containing mycoplasma broth base, serum, and other supplements are required for primary growth, but after adaptation, growth often occurs in less complex media. Defined or semi-defined media are available for some species. Resistant to 10,000 U/ml penicillin. Insensitive to rifampicin, sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline. Isolated from the surfaces of flowers and other plant parts, from the guts and hemolymph of various insects and crustaceans, and from tick triturates. Also isolated from vascular plant fluids (phloem sap) and insects that feed on the fluids. Specific host associations are common. The type species, Spiroplasma citri, is pathogenic for citrus (e.g., orange and grapefruit), producing “stubborn” disease. Experimental or natural infections also occur in horseradish, periwinkle, radish, broad bean, carrot, and other plant species. Spiroplasma kunkelii is a maize pathogen. Some species are pathogenic for insects. Certain species are pathogenic, under experimental conditions, for a variety of suckling rodents (rats, mice, hamsters and rabbits) and/or chicken embryos. Genome sizes vary from 780 to 2220 kbp (PFGE).
Mycoplasma	Pleomorphic cells, 300–800 nm in diameter, varying in shape from spherical, ovoid or flask-shaped, or twisted rods, to slender branched filaments ranging in length from 50 to 500 nm. Cells lack a cell wall and are bounded by a single plasma membrane. Gram-stain-negative due to the absence of a cell wall. Some have a complex internal cytoskeleton. Some have a specific tip structure that mediates attachment to host cells or other surfaces. Usually nonmotile, but gliding motility has been demonstrated in some species. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic. Optimum growth at 37°C is common, but permissive growth temperatures range from 20 to 45°C. Chemo-organotrophic, usually using either sugars or arginine as the major energy source. Require cholesterol or related sterols for growth. Colonies are usually less than 1 mm in diameter. The typical colony has a fried-egg appearance. The genome size of species examined ranges from 580 kbp to about 1350 kbp. The codon UGA encodes tryptophan in all species examined. Commensals or pathogens in a wide range of vertebrate hosts.
Ureaplasma	Coccoid cells about 500 nm in diameter; may appear as coccobacillary forms in exponential growth phase; filaments are rare. Nonmotile. Facultative anaerobes. Form exceptionally small colonies on solid media that are described either as tiny (T) “fried-egg” colonies or as “cauliflower head” colonies having a lobed periphery. Unusual pH required for growth (about 6.0–6.5). Optimal incubation temperature for examined species is 35–37°C. Chemo-organotrophic. Like Mycoplasma, species of Ureaplasma lack oxygen-dependent, NADH oxidase activity. Unlike Mycoplasma, species of Ureaplasma lack hexokinase or arginine deiminase activities but have a unique and obligate requirement for urea and produce potent ureases that hydrolyze urea to CO2 and NH3for energy generation and growth. Genome sizes range from 760 to 1170 kbp (PFGE). Commensals or opportunistic pathogens in vertebrate hosts, primarily birds and mammals (mainly primates, ungulates, and carnivores).

The longer entities usually consist of a mother cell from which a daughter cell is budding, giving rise to serial pairs typical of this bacterial genus. In thin sections cells have two or three membranes consisting of, from inside to outside, a cytoplasmic membrane, an electron-dense outer membrane, and, in many individuals, a vacuolar membrane which is probably derived from the host cell membrane and which often shows discontinuities.

Candidatus Cenarchaeum	The species Candidatus Cenarchaeum symbiosum of the genus Candidatus Cenarchaeum constitutes the sole archaeal symbiont of the temperate marine sponge Axinella mexicana. It represented the first tractable organism of the so-called mesophilic crenarchaeota, now Nitrososphaeria, until pure isolates and enrichment cultures became available. It was also the source of the first assembled full genome of the Nitrososphaeria. Physiological and genomic analyses suggest that representatives of this genus are aerobic, psychrophilic, and capable of a chemolithoautotrophic metabolism, by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite.

Slender rods, 0.15–0.27 µm in diameter and 0.49–2.00 µm in length; some species are motile and possess polar to subpolar flagella. Cells are commonly found in marine and brackish environments and have an obligate salt requirement. Cells are sensitive to light. The cell envelope is composed of a monolayer cell membrane, consisting of crenarchaeol as the major glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether lipid, and a single S-layer in a hexagonally ordered pattern as the outermost boundary.

Nitropumilaceae. The G + C content of the DNA is 33.4–34.2 mol%, which is lower than those of soil and hot spring Thaumarchaeota.
Candidatus Nitrosotalea	Since the late nineteenth century, aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria have been cultivated from a wide range of environments.

One lineage within the Thaumarchaeota, currently represented by the cultivated isolates “Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra” and “Candidatus Nitrosotalea sp. Nd2,” is abundant in acidic soil environments. Both isolates are obligate acidophiles, growing optimally around pH 5.0. These organisms are the first and only cultivated autotrophic ammonia oxidizers that do not grow at neutral pH. They possess ≤90% 16S rRNA gene identity with other cultivated thaumarchaea in genera such as Ca. Nitrosopumilus, Nitrososphaera and Ca. Nitrosocaldus, and Ca.

Most isolates of the species have been recovered from marine salterns.
Haloquadratum	The haloarchaeal species Haloquadratum walsbyi, the only member described of the genus Haloquadratum, dominates NaCl saturated thalassic lakes worldwide. These microbes are unique due to their peculiar flattened and square shape (like a postage stamp), and they contain gas vesicles and granules of poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate. They are red-pink pigmented due to the presence of bacterioruberin carotenoids and bacteriorhodopsin. Reaching populations of up to 108 cells ml−1 they are the most successful halophile. However, pure cultures are extremely fastidious to obtain and grow very slowly in the laboratory. Even 10 years after the isolation of the first two strains, the existence of proven protocols for its isolation and its massive abundance in hypersaline ecosystems, only four more strains of Haloquadratum have been isolated. Most of the information available about this microbe derives from genome and metagenome sequencing. The genomes of the first two pure cultures indicate that they are photoheterotrophs like most members of the class Halobacteria. Their success may be due to the efficient exploitation of solar energy through rhodopsins and their large surface to volume ratio that would facilitate light and organic nutrient harvesting in the brine.
Halorhabdus	The genus Halorhabdus, classified in the family Halobacteriaceae, order Halobacteriales in the class Halobacteria, consists of highly pleomorphic, Gram-stain-negative cells. Some strains exhibit a predominance of cocci- or rod-shaped cells. Strains may produce red or nonpigmented colonies. They are aerobic or facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs; some strains display very poor growth under aerobic conditions, and fermentative capability may be present. Some can grow only on a very narrow range of organic substrates. All are catalase positive, and some show a positive oxidase reaction. Nitrate is reduced to nitrite. Some strains also reduce nitrite. Halorhabdus spp. are extremely halophilic, and cells quickly lyse in water. Magnesium is either not required or only necessary in very small amounts (0.002 M).

In 2013, the two Halosarcina species were reclassified as species of the genus Halogeometricum as Halogeometricum pallidum comb. nov. and Halogeometricum limi comb. nov., so that the genus name Halosarcina, albeit validly published, is no longer in use. Further information about the species can be found in the article on Halogeometricum.
Halosimplex	The genus Halosimplex (family Halobacteriaceae; order Halobacteriales; class Halobacteria) was initially named in reference to the simple medium requirements of the type species.

No growth or methane is obtained with 2-butanol, 2-propanol, cyclopentanol, 2-pentanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, or 2,3-butanediol, with or without H2. Yeast extract, NaCl (1.0%), methylamine, one or more B vitamins, tungstate, and selenite stimulate growth. Form a monophyletic group within the radiation of the “environmental cluster” of Methanomassiliicoccales. Habitat: intestinal tract of human and ruminant.

The two extant species share only 96.3% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, and surveys of 16S rRNA gene sequences in aquatic sediments and bioreactors have found numerous sequences of intermediate relatedness indicating that there are several other species of Methanoregula yet to be cultured.
Methanosphaerula	The genus Methanosphaerula consists of a single species, Methanosphaerula palustris, isolated from a neutral pH minerotrophic fen.

M. palustris is a mesophile that grows from pH 4.8 to 6.4 and is inhibited by >100 mM NaCl and >100 μM sulfide. The genus Methanosphaerula is a member of the family Methanoregulaceae in the order Methanomicrobiales, and there appears to be limited phylogenetic diversity in environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences related to M. palustris, suggesting perhaps only one other species in this genus.
“Nanoarchaeum”	Presently, the genus “Nanoarchaeum” harbors only one species, “Nanoarchaeum equitans”. Cells are tiny cocci (diameters between 0.35 and 0.5 µm), which are directly attached to the surface of their host, Ignicoccus hospitalis cells. This association is mandatory for “N. equitans” to survive and proliferate. “N. equitans” is hyperthermophilic with an optimal growth temperature around 90°C. Its cytoplasmic membrane is covered by a regular surface layer (S-layer) with sixfold symmetry. Cells stain Gram-negative. “N. equitans” must obtain its small-molecule cellular precursors (lipids, amino acids, and sugars) from its host.

Thermogymnomonas	Thermogymnomonas (Itoh, Yoshikawa, and Takashina 2007, 2560VP) is a member of the order Thermoplasmatales. Phylogenetically, it is independent from the hitherto known families of this order, that is, Thermoplasmataceae, Picrophilaceae, Ferroplasmaceae, and the newly proposed Cuniculiplasmaceae. At present, however, no family name has been proposed to include this genus. The genus is represented by the single species, Thermogymnomonas acidicola.
