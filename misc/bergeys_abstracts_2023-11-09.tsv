Bifidobacterium	Bi.fi.do.bac.te'ri.um. L. adj. bifidus cleft, divided; L. neut. n. bacterium a small rod; N.L. neut. n. Bifidobacterium a cleft rodlet. Actinobacteria / Actinobacteria / Bifidobacteriales / Bifidobacteriaceae / Bifidobacterium Rods of various shapes: short, regular, thin cells with pointed ends, coccoidal regular cells, or long cells with slight bends or protuberances or with a large variety of branching; pointed, with slightly bifurcated club-shaped or spatulated extremities; may occur singly or in chains of many elements; may occur in star-like aggregates or in “V” or “palisade” arrangements. Colonies are smooth, convex with entire edges, cream to white, glistening, and of soft consistency. Gram-stain-positive, non-acid-fast, nonsporeforming, and nonmotile. Cells often stain irregularly with methylene blue. Anaerobic; some species can tolerate O2, but only in the presence of CO2 and the more recently described species, such as Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, Bifidobacterium scardovii, and Bifidobacterium tsurumiense, can grow under aerobic conditions (Okamoto et al., 2008). Optimum growth temperature is 37–41°C, except for Bifidobacterium mongoliense, which exhibits an optimal growth temperature of 30°C; minimum growth temperature is 25–28°C, with the exception of Bifidobacterium mongoliense and Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, which can grow at 15°C and 8°C, respectively; maximum growth temperature is 43–45°C, with the exception of Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum, which exhibits a maximal growth temperature of 49.5°C. Growth at 45°C seems to discriminate between animal and human strains, since most of the animal but not the human strains are able to grow at this temperature (Gavini et al., 1991). Optimum pH for initial growth is 6.5–7.0; does not grow at pH 4.5–5.0 (except for Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum, which can grow at pH 4.5) or pH 8.0–8.5. DNA G+C content (mol%): 47–67 (Bd or T m).

Geodermatophilus	Ge.o.der.ma.to.phi'lus. Gr. n. ge earth; Gr. n. derma, atos skin; Gr. adj. philos loving; N.L. masc. n. Geodermatophilus a group of microorganisms that live in the soil, yet that love the skin, by analogy to the genus Dermatophilus, the actinobacterial genus causing a skin disease, that has similar morphological features. Actinobacteria / Actinobacteria / Frankiales / Geodermatophilaceae / Geodermatophilus Morphology is similar to that of Dermatophilus, a group of actinobacteria that have rudimentary hyphae (Figure 1) that eventually develop into complex sporangia (Figure 2). Geodermatophilus strains have been isolated from relatively extreme environments such as desert or high altitude soils. They also appear to resist gamma irradiation and have been recovered from desert soils after exposure to 30 kGy, along with strains of Deinococcus that are more noted for radiation resistance (Rainey et al., 2005). They have been recovered during programs aimed at isolating bacteria, in particular motile ones (Hayakawa et al., 2000), that have atypical metabolic features such as manganese-oxidizing ability, and are frequently associated with “varnish” formation, the black to brown coatings found on rocks in a diverse range of environments (Hungate et al., 1987) and, more surprisingly, in biofilm formation (Singh et al., 2003). Despite several trials, pathogenic lesions have not been produced by inoculation of Geodermatophilus isolates into rabbits (Gordon and Perrin, 1971). These trials had been attempted given the morphological and ontogenetic similarities with Dermatophilus. It is now known these morphological similarities constitute a case of convergent evolution of a few remarkable features rather than phylogenetic similarity. DNA G+C content (mol%): 72.9–74.6.

Ziehl–Neelsen stain (acid-fastness) is negative. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain is positive (red color). Does not grow in standard microbiological media; growth in laboratory animals has not been described. Grows in tissue culture medium in co-culture with human fibroblasts (La Scola, Fenollar, Fournier, Altwegg, Mallet and Raoult, 2001), as well as axenically in tissue culture medium supplemented with extra amino acids (Renesto, Crapoulet, Ogata, La Scola, Vestris, Claverie and Raoult, 2003). Intact cells in culture are observed in intra- and extracellular locations. Grows at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere; anaerobic or completely aerobic growth unknown. Nonmotile. Extremely slow growth; estimated bacterial generation time in culture between 28 and 96 h. When viewed by electron microscopy in infected human tissues, bacterial cells are surrounded by an outer membrane with symmetrical leaflets (Silva, Macedo and Moura Nunes, 1985).

Gram-stain-positive, non-sporulating, and nonmotile. Strictly anaerobic chemo-organotroph; growth is supported by suitable electron acceptors and is proportional to amount of acceptor reduced. Nonfermentative. Growth occurs in anaerobic media containing clarified ruminal fluid, peptone, and a suitable electron acceptor. Dimethyl sulfoxide, nitroethane, 3-nitropropan-1-ol, 2-nitropropan-1-ol, 3-nitropropionate, trimethyl amine-oxide and, by some strains, nitrate, may be used as electron acceptors and support good growth.

Azide, chlorate, fumarate, nitrite, 2-nitrobenzene, perchlorate, sulfate, and sulfite do not support growth. Little if any acid is produced during growth in medium with hydrogen or formate as electron donor. Hydrogen, formate, and ( dl )-Iactate can be used as electron donors; acetate is produced when grown with lactate. Gelatin is not hydrolyzed, indole and H2S are not produced.

Toxothrix	To.xo'thrix. Gr. n. toxon a bow; Gr. fem. n. thrix a thread; N.L. fem. n. Toxothrix bent thread. Bacteroidetes / Cytophagia / Incertae sedis IV / Incertae sedis / Toxothrix Cells cylindrical, colorless, 0.5–0.75×3–6 µm, in filaments (trichomes) up to 400 µm long. A dense body (polyphosphate?) is often located at either end of the cell (Figure 1). Gram reaction not recorded. Filaments often U-shaped (Figure 1a and b) and rotating while slowly moving forward with the rounded part in the lead; a mucoid substance, excreted from several sites on the trailing ends, is deposited as a double track (“railroad track”) of twisted strings each 0.2 µm wide (Figure 1). Fan-shaped structures may be deposited laterally along the tracks, as the arms of the U move from side to side, and between the tracks, as a result of the middle section being lifted and then touched down again (Figure 1; Krul et al., 1970). Oxidized iron may be deposited on the mucoid threads, rendering them yellowish brown and brittle and giving them a diameter of 2.5 µm. Pure cultures have not been obtained, but chemoorganothrophic and psychrophilic cultures have been maintained for long periods at 5 and 10°C. Filaments are extremely fragile during laboratory examination, and explosive disintegration of filaments has been observed after short periods under the microscope. Grow attached to surfaces and develop best at reduced oxygen tensions (Hässelbarth and Lüdemann, 1967) and slightly below neutrality (pH 5.1–7.7). Originally found in water reservoir near the Biological Station at the Dnjepr River in the U.S.S.R. Widely distributed in cold iron springs, brooks, forest ponds, and lakes containing ferrous iron and with reduced oxygen tension (Hirsch, 1981). DNA G+C content (mol%): not known.

Rods, 0.2–0.5 × 1.0–2.5 μm. Nonmotile. No gliding motility. Nonspore-forming. Gram-stain-negative. All strains grow microaerobically and most of them grow aerobically on blood agar. Some strains grow anaerobically at 37°C. Colonies are smooth and nonpigmented or grayish-white to beige. Growth on litmus lactose agar is strain-dependent. No growth occurs on MacConkey agar. Most strains show a positive Voges–Proskauer reaction. Nitrates are not reduced. Acid production from glucose is frequently negative in peptone-containing media. The following enzymes are present: oxidase, catalase, gelatinase, α-glucosidase, α-maltosidase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, esterase lipase C8, esterase C4, naphthol-AS-Bl-phosphohydrolase, leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, and L-aspartic acid arylamidase. The following reactions are strain-dependent: urease, chymotrypsin, trypsin, arginine dihydrolase, indole production, hemolysis on blood, and esculin hydrolysis. Depending on the micro-test kit used, the following enzyme reactions give variable results: β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase, and lipase (these three reactions are positive in the API ID32E and negative in the API ZYM system); and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase [negative in API ZYM and API ID32E, positive in LRA-ZYM-Oxidase (Hinz et al., 1998); only some representative Riemerella anatipestifer strains have been tested using the latter system]. The following enzyme activities are absent: chondroitin sulfatase, hyaluronidase, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, α-mannosidase, α-fucosidase, trypsin, ornithine decarboxylase, and lysine decarboxylase.

Chlamydia	Chla.my'di.a. Gr. fem. n. chlamys, chlamydis a cloak; N.L. fem. n. Chlamydia a cloak. Chlamydiae / Chlamydiia / Chlamydiales / Chlamydiaceae / Chlamydia Coccoid, nonmotile, obligate intracellular organisms, 0.2–1.5 μm in diameter that parasitize and multiply in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells within membrane bound vacuoles, termed inclusions, by a unique developmental cycle. The cycle is characterized by physical changes in the outer membrane and nucleoid structure of metabolically inert elementary bodies that change into larger metabolically active reticulate bodies that divide by binary fission. The cycle is complete when reticulate bodies reorganize into intermediate bodies then to elementary bodies that exit the host cells and start a new generation of the developmental cycle. In a young inclusion, only reticulate bodies are present. However in a mature inclusion, all three forms (reticulate, intermediate, and elementary bodies) are present because the developmental cycle is not synchronized. The intracellular survival of the organism is facilitated by its ability to prevent fusion of lysosomes to chlamydia-containing inclusions by an unknown mechanism. DNA G+C content (mol%): 39–45.

Green Sulfur Bacteria	Introduction. The green sulfur bacteria are predominately aquatic bacteria that grow photosynthetically under anoxic conditions. Similar to Chromatiaceae (purple sulfur bacteria) and purple nonsulfur bacteria (Proteobacteria), the photosynthetic metabolism of green sulfur bacteria differs from that of Cyanobacteria, algae, and green plants in that water cannot serve as an electron-donating substrate and molecular oxygen is not generated. The external electron donors for photosynthetic CO2 assimilation have low redox potentials and comprise reduced sulfur compounds and molecular hydrogen. Green sulfur bacteria can be distinguished from the Chromatiaceae by their distinct bacteriochlorophylls (BChls), the presence of special light-harvesting structures, and their exclusively photolithotrophic metabolism.

Addendum to the Green Sulfur Bacteria Phototrophic green sulfur bacteria living in consortia with other microorganisms	Phototrophic consortia are structural associations between green-or brown-colored and colorless bacteria. The regular structure of these consortia is unique in the microbial world (Schink, 1991). Colored cells contain chlorosomes (e.g., Caldwell and Tiedje, 1975b) and hybridize with 16S rDNA oligonucleotide probes specific for green sulfur bacteria (Tuschak et. al., 1999). This indicates that the colored cells belong to the green sulfur bacteria. So far neither the phototrophic nor the chemotrophic partner are available in pure culture. The isolation of a green sulfur bacterium from the “Chlorochromatium” consortium by Mechsner (1957) was the first step in this direction. Unfortunately, this green sulfur bacterium was lost before detailed metabolic and taxonomic studies were made. Not one of the consortia has so far been isolated in its intact form.

Chloroflexi / “Chloroflexi” / “Herpetosiphonales” / “Herpetosiphonaceae” / Herpetosiphon Herpetosiphon is represented currently by two species that are unbranched, flexible filaments or rods, 0.5–1.5 × 5–150 µm or more (to several mm), consisting of individual cells 2–3 µm long. Appearance of short, transparent “sheaths” extending from ends of some filaments are termed sleeves by Reichenbach (1992) and are characteristic of Herpetosiphon. They may not be true sheaths, but rather the “ghosts” of necridial (dead) cells of the filament (Reichenbach, 1992). Since gliding motility of whole filaments occurs, it is unlikely that a true sheath could exist at that point. Resting stages are unknown. Gram-negative.

Subsection I	Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data (see Turner, 1997; Wilmotte and Herdman, this volume) shows that the unicellular cyanobacteria included in this Subsection do not form a coherent phylogenetic clade but are widely dispersed among strains of other Subsections. Furthermore, with the exception of Cyanobium and Microcystis, all of the genera for which multiple sequence data are available are polyphyletic. Further examples of polyphyly may arise when more sequences are available for genera that are currently represented by only a single sequence. It is presently impossible to classify the “chroococcalean” cyanobacteria on a phylogenetic basis. However, the data emerging from phylogenetic studies support many taxonomic proposals and will help in the subdivision of some of the form-genera discussed here.

Subsection II	Cyanobacteria / Subsection II / Incertae Sedis / Subsection II Cyanobacteria assigned to this Subsection reproduce either exclusively, or at some stages of their life cycle, by the formation of small, spherical cells (baeocytes). These reproductive cells arise from multiple fissions of a parental cell (“vegetative” cell) and are released after rupture of its fibrous outer wall layer. The number of baeocytes released from a parental cell ranges from 4 to over 1000. Enlargement of vegetative cells is accompanied by progressive thickening of the fibrous outer wall layer. Members of some genera divide exclusively by multiple fission. In others, the baeocytes give rise to cell aggregates or pseudofilaments which reproduce by binary fission (“vegetative division”). Subsequently, some or all of the cells composing the aggregates undergo multiple fission and release new baeocytes.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00424/abstract

They range from smaller or larger cell aggregates of variable compactness to very complex structures, all of which exhibit at the periphery pseudofilamentous appendages of varying length.

Subsection III	Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Subsection III It is now apparent from multiple 16S rDNA sequence analyses that this subsection is not phylogenetically coherent. Some of the genera of this former order and even named species of the genus Oscillatoria, for example, are polyphyletic (see Turner, 1997; Phylogenetic relationships amongst the Cyanobacteria, p. 487). It is premature to reclassify this “oscillatorian” group of morphotypes on the basis of the still incompletely determined genetic relationships. The present treatment, therefore, will follow the older, artificial grouping of Subsection III, although the degree of genetic similarities of some genera (on the basis of nucleotide and other sequence similarities) are mentioned in the text description of each genus and also in the discussion in the chapter on phylogeny.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00432/abstract
Form- Arthrospira	Ar.thro.spi' ra. Gr. n. arthron a joint; L. n. spira a coil; M.L. fem. n. Arthrospira jointed coil. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Arthrospira The entire trichome is arranged as an open helix, in which cross-walls may be seen via light microscopy, but not too easily when gas vacuoles are abundant (Figure 1). However, the vesicles can be easily collapsed by centrifugation or by exerting pressure on a suspension in a plastic syringe by pushing against a rubber stopper. Cells are generally shorter than broad or isodiametric. Slight constrictions at crosswalls may be present or absent. In some strains the terminal cells may acquire a cap-like thickening of the outer cell wall, termed a calyptra. A single circle of junctional pores (i.e., near crosswalls) seems to be typical for members of this genus, and fimbriae are closely appressed along the trichome (E.M.) (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1982a, b). Persistent sheaths are not produced. Gliding motility is evident in most strains. Thylakoids have a radial arrangement in trichome cross-section. Trichome width among the numerous isolates in culture varies from about 5–12 µm, although smaller forms (3 µm) have been described from nature. The helix is an open spiral with wave amplitudes ranging from 30 to 60 µm, with interhelical spacing of similar dimensions (Ciferri, 1983; Ciferri and Tiboni, 1985). On solid medium, the helix undergoes a transition to a “flat spiral”. Considerable variation in degree of helix pitch occurs within some strains, and culture variants that are nearly straight are also found (Jeeji-Bai, 1985; R. Rippka, unpublished).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00433/abstract
Form- Borzia	Bor' zi.a. M.L. fem. n. Borzi named after A. Borzi, Italian cyanobacteriologist. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Borzia This genus is characterized by very short trichomes of 2–8 (16) cells, with conspicuous constrictions at crosswalls, of various diameters; motility slight or lacking; cells usually shorter than broad. This last characteristic seems to be the main feature separating this genus from Pseudanabaena (as represented in this volume), since many strains of Pseudanabaena consistently exhibit comparably short trichomes. Brevitrichomy may also occur in other filamentous cyanobacteria (Pinevich et al., 1997), and mutants with short trichomes have been isolated from heterocystous forms such as Anabaena (Bauer et al., 1995). Thus this property may be trivial, which could be demonstrated by genetic analyses on typical representatives of this “genus”. Hormoscilla Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988 is very similar to Borzia and will not be considered here. A species isolated by E.G. Pringsheim and conforming to the description of Borzia trilocularis (Pringsheim, 1968) exists in culture strain SAG B 1407–1, but has been assigned to Hormoscilla pringsheimii (Schlösser, 1994).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00434/abstract
Form- Crinalium	Cri.na' li.um. L. adj. crinalis of hair; Gr. suff. -ion diminutive; M.L. neut. n. Crinalium small hairlike (filament). Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Crinalium Members of this genus share structural similarities with Oscillatoria. The trichome is flattened to elliptical in cross-section rather than cylindrical (or triradiate as in Starria). The only representative in axenic culture (strain PCC 9333), described as Crinalium epipsammum (SAG 22.89), has short cells (1–1.5 µm) that are 2–2.5 µm in narrow width and 5–7 µm in breadth (De Winder et al., 1990). The terminal cells are undifferentiated. Binary fission as in Oscillatoria. Trichomes are nonmotile. As seen in transmission electron microscopy, thylakoids are mainly parallel to the long axis and close to the cell periphery. The cell wall peptidoglycan layer is thick (80–100 nm). Reported to have a mean DNA base composition of 33.9 mol% G + C and to contain high levels of cellulose II, associated with the cell envelope (de Winder et al., 1990). A thin sheath may exist. No PE; β-carotene and echinenone are the major carotenoids. There is no N2 fixation under anoxic or oxic conditions. Apparently common in terrestrial sandy areas as surface crusts and is desiccation-resistant. Two other species from field collections have been characterized poorly (see Desikachary, 1959).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00435/abstract
Form- Geitlerinema stat. nov.	Geit' ler.i.nema. Geitler Lothar Geitler, Austrian cyanobacterial taxonomist, 1899–1990; Gr. n. nema thread; M.L. fem. n. Geitlerinema Geitler's thread or filament. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Geitlerinemia Filamentous cyanobacteria which form straight to slightly sinuous cylindrical trichomes that divide by binary fission; trichome breakage transcellular. Trichomes less than 5–6 μm in diameter; cells longer than broad or isodiametric, never disc- or coin-like; constrictions between adjacent cells are absent or very shallow; apical cells are rounded, conical or distinctly pointed, tapered, and often bent. Polar gas vesicles rarely present; large cyanophycin granules near crosswalls in some species. Ultrastructural studies of strain PCC 7105 demonstrated a single circular row of pores near the crosswalls (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1982a); whether this holds for the other strains assigned to this genus is unknown. Trichomes of freshly isolated cultures or observed in field material show active gliding motility accompanied by trichome rotation, sometimes leaving behind an extremely thin trail (or almost invisible sheath). Copious amounts of gel-like matter may be produced by some strains, particularly in axenic liquid culture. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 53–67 (Rippka and Herdman, 1992).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00436/abstract
Form- Leptolyngbya	Lep.to.lyng' by.a. Gr. adj. leptos delicate or thin; lyngbya named after H.C. Lyngbye, Danish botanist, 1782–1837; Lyngbya another genus of cyanobacteria; M.L. fem. n. Leptolyngbya delicate or thin Lyngbya. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Leptolyngbya Cylindrical trichomes less than 3 μm in diameter; cells isodiametric or longer than wide; constrictions between cells are generally absent or shallow, seldom exceeding 1/8 of the trichome diameter; trichome breakage may be trans- or inter-cellular; apical cells rounded (or exceptionally conical) (Figure 1); persistent sheaths may be produced but are not of firm consistency (and not laminated); in some members, several trichomes may be surrounded by a “mucous-like” matrix. Trichomes nonmotile (or inconspicuously motile as seen by light microscopy, <0.1 μm/s), except for transient motile hormogonia when free of any sheath or coalescent “mucous” material. Some strains or natural specimens may undergo false branching, which may depend mainly on sheath strength.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00437/abstract
Form- Limnothrix	Lim' no.thrix. Gr. n. lime lake; Gr. n. thrix, trichos thread or hair; M.L. fem. n. Limnothrix lake hair or lake thread. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Limnothrix The members of this genus, although morphologically similar and apparently phylogenetically closely related to Pseudanabaena spp., deserve separate mention because they are typical constituents of the freshwater plankton (Meffert, 1987). Trichomes composed of elongate cells (although sometimes isodiametric), typically 1–3 µm in diameter (exceptionally up to 6 µm); constrictions between cells indistinct or shallow. Apical cells rounded. Generally synthesis of conspicuous gas vacuoles near both cell poles and in the center of predivisional cells, but sometimes dispersed throughout the cells (Figure 1). Motility lacking or very slight; reproduction by random intercellular trichome breakage. With T.E.M., thylakoids are mainly peripheral.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00438/abstract
Form- Lyngbya	Lyng' by.a. M.L. fem. n. Lyngbye named after H.C. Lyngbye, Danish botanist, 1782–1837. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Lyngbya Filamentous organisms that share the entire range of cellular types with Oscillatoria (as here defined), but which produce a distinct, persistent, and firm sheath (Figure 1). The sheath may be thin but can be seen with phase contrast optics, particularly where it extends beyond the terminal cell of the trichome (Fig 1). The trichome diameters range from about 6 to ∼80 µm. Sheaths in some species may accrete to several µm in thickness and display laminations. Cells composing the trichomes are disk shaped (shorter than broad), a feature also characteristic of Oscillatoria (as here defined).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00439/abstract
Form- Microcoleus	Mi.cro.co' le.us. Gr. adj. mikros small (or thin); Gr. n. koleos sheath; M.L. masc. n. Microcoleus small or thin sheath. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Microcoleus In members assigned to this form-genus, two to several trichomes oriented parallel, often spirally and tightly interwoven, are enclosed by a common homogeneous sheath (Figure 1). Cells (diameter 3–6 µm) composing the trichomes are longer than wide (or isodiametric); visible constrictions at the cross-walls (but usually much less than 1/4 of the cell diameter); mature end cells are conical; the bundles of filaments generally exhibit slow gliding motility, not involving rotation. Based on analysis of a limited number of isolates, a radial arrangement of thylakoids (in cross-section, T.E.M.) seems to be typical.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00440/abstract
Form- Oscillatoria	Os.cil.la.to' ri.a. L. v. oscillare to swing; L. adj. suffix -torius belonging to; M.L. fem. n. Oscillatoria (filament) that swings. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Oscillatoria Filamentous organisms that divide exclusively by binary fission and in one plane. The cylindrical trichomes are straight (except for the terminal region in some cases); flexible or semirigid; over ∼4 µm in diameter; disc-like cells wider than long. The trichome diameter of cultured representatives is 4–16 µm, but species with trichomes up to >100 µm in diameter have been described in the botanical literature. Invariably, in larger trichomes (>10 µm in diameter) the cells are much shorter than broad. Cross-walls are generally visible by light microscopy (Figures 1 and 2). Constrictions at cross-walls are lacking or slight, but the total indentation never exceeds 1/8 of the trichome diameter. Generally, the cross-wall is thinner than the longitudinal wall. The initiation of cross-wall synthesis by centripetal growth precedes the completion of previously initiated cross-walls (Figure 3). During fission, the cytoplasmic membrane invaginates, with a thinner peptidoglycan layer following and separating the new membranes of the daughter cells. This characteristic also applies to the genera Spirulina, Arthrospira, and Lyngbya. Reproduction of trichomes is by transcellular breakage involving sacrificial cell death (i.e., “necridial” cells).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00441/abstract
Form- Planktothrix	Plank' to.thrix. Gr. n. planktos wandering; Gr. n. thrix thread or hair; M.L. fem. n. Planktothrix wandering (or planktonic) hair. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Planktothrix This genus (Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988) corresponds to Cluster 5 of Oscillatoria (sensu Rippka and Herdman, 1992). It is based primarily on the structural and ecological features of O. agardhii and O. rubescens, which are well known planktonic filamentous cyanobacteria with abundant gas vacuoles (Figure 1). Typical of eutrophic or hypereutrophic freshwater lakes or reservoirs, the trichomes of these organisms often form clusters or fascicles and often represent a major constituent of “water blooms”. Like Oscillatoria (sensu stricto) the cells are shorter than broad or isodiametric, and the trichomes exhibit gliding motility by rotation; prominent sheath layers are not produced; the cell diameter of all representatives presently in culture ranges from 3.5 to 10 µm (Skulberg and Skulberg, 1982; Rippka, unpublished). C-PE may be present or absent. Some strains were reported to produce the secondary metabolite 7-methylheptadecane (Jüttner, 1991).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00442/abstract
Form- Prochlorothrix	Pro' chlor' o.thrix. Gr. pref. protos first (primordial); Gr. adj. chloros green; Gr. n. thrix hair or thread; M.L. fem. n. Prochlorothrix primordial green hair. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Prochlorothrix Prochlorothrix is a filamentous organism that divides exclusively by binary fission in one plane and has slight to prominent constrictions at the cross-walls. Cells are longer (3–10 µm) than broad (0.5–1.5 µm in diameter). However, under salt stress (i.e., 25 mM NaCl) cells may enlarge to reach 15 µm in length and 3 µm in width. Thylakoids arranged in layers parallel to the long axis at the periphery of the cytoplasm. Phycobilisomes absent. Motility absent; polar gas vacuoles present; sheaths absent or poorly developed; apical cells undifferentiated (rounded). Lacks N2-fixing ability. Phycobiliproteins (i.e., CPE, C-PC, and APC) absent; chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b present. Zeaxanthin and β-carotene are the major carotenoids.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00443/abstract
Form- Pseudanabaena	Pseud' an.a.baen' a. Gr. adj. pseud false; anabaena (cf. genus Anabaena); M.L. fem. n. Pseudanabaena false Anabaena. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Pseudanabaena Trichomes that divide exclusively by binary fission in one plane and have conspicuous constrictions at the crosswalls that may exceed half the cell diameter (Figure 1). In some strains, the total constriction is less but is still more than 1/8 the cell diameter (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1984a). Cells are longer than broad to isodiametric and are often barrel-shaped. Trichomes of strains characterized in culture range from ∼1 to 3 µm in diameter. The formation of the transverse septum involves a partial centripetal ingrowth of all wall layers. In some cases, the remaining connection appears quite narrow, as if the cells were strung as beads. The structural (peptidoglycan) layer of the cross-wall is 3–6 times thicker than the layer surrounding the rest of the cell (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1984a) (Figure 2). Another characteristic observed through T.E.M. is the consistency of peripheral thylakoids, parallel to the cell walls. Near the cross-walls, the continuity of thylakoids may be interrupted by gas vesicle clusters. The trichomes are usually straight and, depending on the morphotype, may be quite short (consisting of less than 3 to ∼10 cells) or may be longer (>10 cells). Reproduction by intercellular trichome breakage. Single detached cells are frequently found in cultured populations and may be confused with unicellular cyanobacteria (Castenholz, unpublished). Gliding motility, probably without rotation, occurs at rates usually <1 µm/s. Gliding motility has been lost in a few cultured strains (Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1984a).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00444/abstract
Form- Spirulina	Spi.ru.li' na. L. n. spira a coil; L. n. linea a line; M.L. fem. n. Spirulina coiled filament. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Spirulina Filamentous organisms that divide exclusively by binary fission and in one plane but that grow in the form of a tight to nearly tight, coiled right- or left-handed helix, although this helix may become partly unwound in some trichomes of cultured populations. More loosely coiled representatives often form partial double helices composed of two individual filaments that rotated into each other. The cross-walls are thin and barely visible even if observed by light microscopy using phase contrast objectives, a characteristic that distinguishes this genus from Arthrospira (Holmgren et al., 1971) (Figure 1). Originally Spirulina was described as being a long unicellular thread. No sheath is visible under the light microscope, and “healthy” trichomes are in constant motion. Gliding motility consists of a “turning of the screw”, thus with great transverse movement and little forward motion. Motility is by rotation around the outer surface of the helix. Free ends not in contact with a solid support may oscillate wildly as the coil turns. The terminus of the trichome is either blunt or pointed. In different species the diameter of the trichome can range from <1 µm to ∼5 µm in size. In the latter case, the width of the whole helix may be as great as 12 µm. Color is variable, blue-green to red; the latter being typical of some marine representatives that synthesize C-PE as the major light-harvesting pigment, but contain relatively little PC and APC. Although C-PE content may vary inversely with light intensity, complementary chromatic adaptation has not been observed (Tomaselli et al., 1995). Spirulina isolates seem to be stable with respect to trichome structure. Straight variants, as found often in Arthrospira (Jeeji-Bai and Seshadri, 1980; Lewin, 1980; Rippka, unpublished), have not been observed, even after maintenance in culture for more than 30 years (Rippka, unpublished).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00445/abstract
Form- Starria	Star' ri.a. M.L. fem. n. Starria Starr, named after R.C. Starr, U.S. phycologist (1924–1998). Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Starria This nonbranching filamentous cyanobacterium is unique in that the short trichomes are triradiate in cross-section (Lang, 1977). The immotile trichomes are straight to helically twisted. The cells are significantly shorter (length 1–2 µm) than wide (diameter ∼15 µm). The triradiate form usually has broad, arm-like projections 120 degrees apart, separated by U-shaped depressions (Figure 1). The pigmentation is concentrated in the arms. A thin sheath (3 µm thick) covers the trichome. Cross-walls are as found in the genus Oscillatoria, with an invagination of the peptidoglycan layer but not of the outer membrane. The relatively thick peptidoglycan layer of longitudinal walls is characterized by evenly distributed pits 70 nm in diameter, as in some species of Oscillatoria (e.g., O. princeps) (Halfen and Castenholz, 1971; Guglielmi and Cohen-Bazire, 1982b). Little is known about the physiology or biochemistry of this organism, but its very unusual structure has been documented by light and electron microscopy (Lang, 1977). This organism is known from a single strain isolated from a terrestrial sample in Zimbabwe. The scarce record of Starria may not imply that it is rare, since cyanobacteria of the soil have not been studied extensively.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00446/abstract
Form- Symploca	Sym.plo' ca. Gr. adj. sym together; Gr. n. plokos lock of hair; M.L. fem. n. Symploca clustered hair. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Symploca Trichomes that divide by binary fission in one plane only, with a prominent and persistent sheath (a single trichome per sheath, often with frequent false branching). In contrast to Lyngbya (as treated here), the cells are isodiametric, or slightly longer than broad, and less than 6 µm in width. The constrictions between cells are shallow. The sheathed filaments are arranged in bundles, often forming tufts or turfs in moist terrestrial or intertidal habitats. Geitler (1932) recognized 22 species. This form-genus is very tentative, since many types of ensheathed filamentous cyanobacteria may correspond to this poor definition and some strains of the form-genus Leptolyngbya, and of Lyngbya as defined here, exhibit aerial growth on solid substrates or form pinnacles or tufts under moist culture conditions. However, an approach such as has been taken for the genus Microcoleus, which under the current definition is primarily based on a single morpho- and ecotype (Microcoleus chthonoplastes, see earlier), may be necessary for a more precise concept of Symploca. Strain PCC 8002, although originally described as Microcoleus chthonoplastes (Pearson et al., 1979), does not share the structural features of this species, but rather conforms more to the description of Symploca atlantica Gomont 1892 or Symploca funicularis Setchell and Gardner 1918. The former species has been extensively described by Gomont (1893) on the basis of field collections from intertidal mats in France (where it was found in association with Microcoleus chthonoplastes), whereas the description of S. funicularis, possibly a synonymous species, is based on field material from the coast in California (Setchell and Gardner, 1918). Typically for these two botanical species, the trichomes of strain PCC 8002 are of medium size (5–6 µm in diameter) and are heavily ensheathed. In contrast to Microcoleus chthonoplastes, the terminal cells are not conical but rounded and carry a small “hat-like” flat-pointed to convex calyptra; 1–10 subterminal cells are consistently less pigmented (yellowish), irrespective of the source of nitrogen; on solid media the trichomes exhibit upright aerial growth; although isolated from a marine environment, this strain is euryhaline (Rippka, unpublished). It synthesizes neither PE nor PEC, and MAA (mycosporine-like amino acids) were not detected (Karsten and Garcia-Pichel, 1996). Most importantly, strain PCC 8002 is one of the rare nonheterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria capable of fixing N2 under oxic conditions (Pearson et al., 1979), even if incubated under a continuous light regime (Rippka, unpublished).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00447/abstract
Form- Trichodesmium	Trich' o.des' mium. Gr. n. trichos hair; Gr. n. desmos bond; M.L. neut. n. Trichodesmium bonded filaments. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form- Trichodesmium Filamentous cyanobacteria that divide exclusively by binary fission and in one plane. Trichomes of different species or strains range from 6 to 22 µm in diameter. Cells are isodiametric or slightly longer than broad; constrictions at cross-walls are shallow. Trichomes are arranged in parallel fascicles or form radiate macroscopic clusters; Trichodesmium species often occur as major constituents of the plankton in tropical to semi-tropical oceans; they are reddish to orange in color, containing PE with phycourobilin (PUB) chromophores, exhibiting an absorption peak at ∼493–495 nm (Fujita and Shimura, 1 9 7 4; Glazer, 1 9 8 9). All known members contain abundant gas vacuoles (Figure 1), generally dispersed throughout the cells, and particularly resistant to collapse, even at hydrostatic pressures of 12–27 bars (Walsby, 1 9 9 4).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00448/abstract
Form- Tychonema	Ty'cho.nem' a. Gr. n. tychos luck, accident; Gr. n. nema thread; M.L. fem. n. Tychonema accidental thread. Cyanobacteria / Subsection III / Incertae Sedis / Form-Tychonema This genus was created by Anagnostidis and Komárek (1988) and includes filamentous cyanobacteria that resemble in most respects strains typical of Oscillatoria (as defined here). The only characteristics of diagnostic value are thought to be the presence of a sap vacuole (as in eucaryotic algae) and a reticulated network of cytoplasmic strands which contain the thylakoids (Figures 1 and 2). Trichomes of freshwater morphotypes range in diameter from 2 to 16 µm and gas vacuoles are lacking (Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988). However, cultured isolates of the botanical morphotypes Oscillatoria bornetii Zukal 1894 ex Geitler 1932 and O. bornetii f. tenuis Skuja 1930, later assigned to Tychonema (Anagnostidis and Komárek, 1988), exhibit a more narrow range in size (diameters 12–16 µm and 4–8 µm, respectively) (Skulberg and Skulberg, 1985). These isolates all contain PE and undergo complementary chromatic adaptation; myxoxanthophyll and oscillaxanthin seem to be the characteristic carotenoids (Skulberg and Skulberg, 1985). Another representative of this “genus” that has been cultured but subsequently lost, is a much larger species (diameter up to 60 µm) that occurs commonly in tychoplankton of protected marine waters of Bermuda (R.W. Castenholz, unpublished; Figure 3).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00449/abstract
Subsection IV	Cyanobacteria / Subsection IV / Incertae Sedis / Subsection IV Members of Subsection IV are filamentous cyanobacteria that divide exclusively by binary fission in one plane, perpendicularly to the long axis of the trichomes. Cell division occurs at similar rates throughout the trichome or, in some genera, may be more rapid in “meristematic” zones of the filaments (Castenholz, 1989b; Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1989; Whitton, 1989). With the exception of some representatives of the genus Nostoc, the trichomes are always clearly uniseriate. The ensheathed filaments of some genera (e.g., Calothrix or Scytonema) may exhibit false branching, a developmental process distinct from true branching that occurs only in members of Subsection V (see Hoffman and Castenholz, this volume) and involves cellular division in more than one plane. Several genera are defined by a basal–apical polarity of the filaments (i.e., tapering trichomes), the apical extremity often terminating in thin and colorless cells, termed “hair” cells (Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1989; Whitton, 1989). The trichome diameter among members of Subsection IV presently in culture varies greatly, ranging from about 2 µm (Cylindrospermopsis) to 15 µm (i.e., members of Scytonema, Calothrix, and Rivularia).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00450/abstract
Subsection IV.I	In cyanobacteria of subsection IV.I the trichomes never exhibit basal–apical polarity, all vegetative cells being of uniform size. With the exception of Scytonema, cell divisions seem to occur at similar rates throughout the trichomes. Members of some genera undergo a distinct developmental cycle, involving hormogonia formation. Although some representatives may produce ensheathed trichomes, false branching is extremely rare, occurring frequently only in Scytonema. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, some members differentiate heterocysts exclusively in terminal or intercalary positions; others exhibit both terminal and intercalary heterocysts. Akinetes (if present) may be formed singly or in short chains (two to three akinetes) exclusively adjacent to, or very close to, heterocysts. In some members, they are initiated equidistant between two heterocysts, successive differentiation on either side of the first akinete often leading to very long chains of akinetes, often comprising the majority of the cell population. Some botanical genera (e.g., Anabaenopsis and Cylindrospermum) are easily identified by the location and/or spacing of heterocysts or akinetes.

Cyanobacteria / Subsection IV / Subsection IV.I / Form-Scytonema The mature trichomes are immotile, heavily ensheathed, and form numerous false branches that exhibit upright aerial mode of growth. Constrictions between the disk-shaped to cylindrical cells are shallow. Heterocysts generally occupy intercalary positions, although some false branches may carry at their base a terminal heterocyst. Hormogonia are less ensheathed, exhibit no or only slow motility, and differ little in cell morphology from the mature filaments. Akinetes are not produced.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00460/abstract
Subsection IV.II	Cyanobacteria / Subsection IV / Subsection IV.II This Subsection includes two genera, Calothrix and Rivularia, traditionally assigned to the botanical family “Rivulariaceae”, and two genera, Tolypothrix and Microchaete, members of the “Scytonemataceae” and “Microchaetaceae”, respectively (see Geitler, 1932). Representatives of the former two genera exhibit mature trichomes that have a distinct basal–apical polarity and display a high degree of tapering, the ratios of cell width of the basal to apical cells varying between 3 and 5. Freshly released hormogonia do not display basal–apical polarity, exhibit transient gliding motility, and differ distinctly in cell size and morphology from the mature trichomes. Members of the genera Tolypothrix and Microchaete share most structural and developmental properties with the “rivulariacean” genera, but the mature trichomes, even if grown in the absence of combined nitrogen, exhibit only a very low degree of tapering, the ratios of cell width of the basal to apical cells being less than 2. Other distinguishing traits are described in more detail below.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00461/abstract

Cyanobacteria / Subsection IV / Subsection IV.II / Form-Calothrix Mature ensheathed trichomes exhibit a pronounced degree of tapering. The motile hormogonia are generally very short, exhibit a significantly reduced cell diameter, and are sheathless (or less ensheathed). They give rise to trichomes that differentiate a basal, one-pored heterocyst. False branching frequent. Akinetes lacking in most members.

False branches are frequent, often subtending a “basal” heterocyst. Hormogonia, generally motile and often containing gas vesicle clusters dispersed throughout the cells, give rise to young trichomes that differentiate a single terminal heterocyst. All are freshwater or soil inhabitants. Akinetes are lacking.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00464/abstract
Subsection V	Cyanobacteria / Subsection V / Incertae Sedis / Subsection V Genera of this subsection exhibit the highest degree of morphological complexity and differentiation within the cyanobacteria; the few available 16S rDNA sequence data analyses suggest that it is a monophyletic group, arising from within an assemblage of filamentous heterocystous cyanobacteria that divide in a single plane (Turner, 1997; “Phylogenetic relationships amongst the Cyanobacteria,” p. 487). Longitudinal and oblique cell divisions occur in addition to transverse cell divisions. This results in periodic true branching in all genera and in multiseriate trichomes (two or more rows of cells) in some genera. Three major types of true branchings, named “T”, “V”, and “Y”, can be distinguished (Golubic et al., 1996). T-branching is a lateral, nearly perpendicular branching originating from the change of division plane from transverse to longitudinal (Figure 1), V-branching is a dichotomous or pseudodichotomous bifurcation originating from a change in division plane at, or close to, the trichome tip (Figure 2), and Y-branching arises from the displacement of an intercalary branch-point cell by surrounding meristematic growth (Figure 3). False branching also occurs in some genera. Pit-like synapses or pore channels occur between the cells of trichomes in some of these genera. Heterocysts are both intercalary and terminal. Although reproduction occurs by random breakage of trichomes, hormogonia are also formed in most strains. Akinetes or akinete- like cells are produced by some genera.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00465/abstract
Form-Chlorogloeopsis	Chlor' ogloe.op' sis. Gr. adj. chloros green; Gr. adj. gloios sticky; Gr. n. opsis appearance, hence resemblance; M.L. fem. n. Chlorogloeopsis (cyanobacterium) resembling Chlorogloea Mitra. Cyanobacteria / Subsection V / Incertae Sedis / Form-Chlorogloeopsis The filamentous nature of this organism is often unclear, except in the hormogonia. Hormogonia are composed of short chains of cylindrical or barrel-shaped cells which, after ceasing motility, enlarge to become spherical cells (Figure 1). Extracellular sheath is present. Heterocysts develop in both intercalary and terminal positions when levels of combined nitrogen are low. Growth continues, with cell divisions in more than one plane (Figure 1), so that multiseriate trichomes develop. The filamentous nature of the organisms is usually lost, however, since the growing mass of cells commonly fragments into clusters or amorphous aggregates of cells, generally within a mucilaginous sheath (Rippka et al., 1979) (Figure 1). Hormogonia arise from such aggregates. Uneven (asymmetric) divisions of vegetative cells occur; small heterocysts occur when strains are deprived of combined nitrogen (Foulds and Carr, 1981). Masses of vegetative cells may also enlarge to form thicker-walled cells (akinetes or akinete-like cells). Akinete germination takes place with division in several planes and the shedding of extra wall layers (Rippka et al., 1979). Synaptic “pore channels”, common in many other genera in Subsection V, are not present.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00466/abstract
Form-Fischerella	Fisch.er.el' la. M.L. fem. n. Fischerella Fischer, probably named for B. Fischer, botanical bacteriologist, 1852–1915. Cyanobacteria / Subsection V / Incertae Sedis / Form-Fischerella The true branches of these organisms are uniseriate and composed of cells, particularly those distal from the base, that are generally longer than broad. The axis (primary trichome) from which they arise is also mainly uniseriate, but may become multiseriate in part, with divisions in more than one plane. The axis in these regions, however, is seldom more than 2–3 cells in thickness. In addition, the cells of the axes become enlarged, often semispherical in shape. The older cells of a main axis may become separated from each other by sheath material and may act as akinetes (Martin and Wyatt, 1974). Most of the widened cells of the axial trichome, however, display a true filamentous nature, with only a peptidoglycan septum separating cells (Nierzwicki et al., 1982; Balkwill et al., 1984). The main axis forms when a hormogonium comes to rest, cells enlarge, and cell divisions that are parallel to the long axis or diagonal (oblique) begin; some of the resulting cells elongate to form branches (secondary trichomes) (Balkwill et al., 1984; Nierzwicki-Bauer et al., 1984) (Figure 1). Extracellular sheaths are absent.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00467/abstract
Form-Geitleria	Geit.ler' i.a. M.L. fem. n. Geitleria Geitler, named after L. Geitler, Austrian botanist and specialist in cyanobacteria, 1899–1990. Cyanobacteria / Subsection V / Incertae Sedis / Form-Geitleria Branching is pseudodichotomous, dichotomous, and lateral (Figure 1). The sheath becomes heavily calcified, and only cells near the tips of trichomes are able to give rise to a lateral branch or, when an apical cell undergoes an oblique division followed by further divisions of both cells, to a false dichotomy (Friedmann, 1955). The ultrastructure of decalcified specimens, including pore channels (i.e. “pit connections”), has been studied by Couté (1982, 1985) (Figure 1). No cultures of this genus have been established.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00468/abstract

Cyanobacteria / Subsection V / Incertae Sedis / Form-Iyengariella Besides true and pseudodichotomous branchings, false branchings are also found; false branches occur after trichome breakage as a result of the formation of a necridium. True dichotomous branches originate from the longitudinal division of the apical cell and pseudodichotomous true branches originate from the oblique division of an intercalary cell. Filaments taper, the trichomes ending in long whips of the rivulariacean type. Heterocysts and akinetes are absent. Reproduction is through hormogonia- formation.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00469/abstract

Cyanobacteria / Subsection V / Incertae Sedis / Form-Nostochopsis The uniseriate trichomes form lateral T-branchings of two types, one long and many celled, the other one of limited growth (1–3 cells) with a heterocyst at the end; besides these pedicellate heterocysts, heterocysts are intercalary or lateral and sessile. A culture of this genus has been established (Weber et al., 1996), but has not been studied taxonomically.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00470/abstract

Firmicutes / “Bacilli” / Bacillales / Pasteuriaceae / Pasteuria Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria. Propagation following germination within a nematode or cladoceran host proceeds through the formation of rounded to elliptical (termed “cauliflower-like” by Metchnikoff, 1888) vegetative microcolonies from which “daughter” microcolonies may be formed. The sporogenous cells at the periphery of the colonies are usually attached by narrow “sacrificial” intercalary hyphae that lyse, resulting in developing sporangia arranged in clumps of eight or more, but more often in quartets, triplets, or doublets and, finally, as single teardrop-shaped or cup-shaped or rhomboidal mature sporangia. The rounded end of the sporangium encloses a single refractile endospore (1.0–3.0 µm in major dimension), an oblate spheroid, ellipsoidal or almost spherical in shape, usually resistant to desiccation and elevated temperatures (one species has somewhat limited heat tolerance). Nonmotile. Sporangia and microcolonies are endoparasitic in the bodies of freshwater, plant, and soil invertebrates. Axenic cultivation has not been documented, but it can be grown in the laboratory with its invertebrate host. The pathogen is horizontally transmitted via soil or waterborne spores.

Firmicutes / “Bacilli” / “Lactobacillales” / Lactobacillaceae / Pediococcus Nine species are recognized within this genus, including Pediococcus acidilactici (Lindner, 1887; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus claussenii (Dobson et al., 2002), Pediococcus cellicola (Zhang et al., 2005), Pediococcus damnosus (Balcke, 1884; Claussen, 1903; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus dextrinicus (Back, 1978a; Coster and White, 1964; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus inopinatus (Back, 1978a, 1988), Pediococcus parvulus (Günther and White, 1961; Skerman et al., 1980), Pediococcus pentosaceus (Mees, 1934; Skerman et al., 1980) with the subspecies Pediococcus pentosaceus subsp. pentosaceus and Pediococcus pentosaceus subsp. intermedius, and Pediococcus stilesii (Franz et al., 2006). The Pediococcus type species is Pediococcus damnosus (Claussen, 1903).

Firmicutes / “Bacilli” / “Lactobacillales” / “Leuconostocaceae” / Oenococcus Cells are Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, and asporogenous. Ellipsoidal to spherical in shape, usually arranged in pairs or chains. Cell morphology varies with strain and is influenced by growth medium and age. Chemo-organotrophic, facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative, no cytochromes present. Usually nonproteolytic. Exoprotease activity has been reported for a strain isolated from a red wine produced in Argentina (Manca de Nadra et al., 2005). Nitrate is not reduced. Nonhemolytic. Indole is not formed. Acidophilic (prefers an initial growth pH of 4.8) or non-acidophilic (growth at pH 5.0–7.5; pH 6.0–6.8 as optimum), depending on the species. Growth in media supplemented with 5% (v/v) ethanol is usual, but growth in the presence of 10% (v/v) ethanol depends on the species. Growth in broth is slow and usually uniform. Surface growth is enhanced by incubation in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Colonies usually develop only after 5 d and are less than 1 mm in diameter. Grows between 20 and 30 °C. Requires a rich medium with complex growth factors and amino acids. Tomato juice, grape juice, pantothenic acid, or 4′- O -(β-glucopyranosyl)- d -pantothenic acid may be required for growth and depends on the species. Glucose is fermented to equal amounts of d (−)-lactic acid, CO2, and ethanol or acetate via a pathway not yet fully elucidated. l -malate is decarboxylated to L (+)-lactate in the presence of a fermentable carbohydrate. Polysaccharides and most alcohols are not metabolized. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-P-DH) not present.

Weissella	Weiss.el'la. N.L. dim. fem. n. named after Norbert Weiss, a German microbiologist known for his many research contributions to the taxonomy of the lactic acid bacteria. Firmicutes / “Bacilli” / “Lactobacillales” / “Leuconostocaceae” / Weissella The description for the genus is as published by Collins et al. (1993). The cells are either short rods with rounded tapered ends (see Figure 120 for Weissella cibaria) or ovoid and occur in pairs or in short chains. A tendency toward pleomorphism may be found for strains in species such as Weissella minor (see Figure 121). Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, and asporogenous. Chemo-organotrophic, facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative, and devoid of cytochromes. Obligately fermentative chemo-organotrophs; ferment glucose heterofermentatively and have complex nutritional requirements. The genus Weissella belongs to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) because of their metabolism and phylogenetic position. Carbohydrate fermentation via the hexose-monophosphate and the phosphoketolase pathways. End products of glucose fermentation are CO2, ethanol, and/or acetate. The configuration of lactic acid is either DL- or D(−), depending on the species. Amino acids, peptides, fermentable carbohydrates, fatty acids, nucleic acids, and vitamins are generally required for growth. Biotin, nicotine, thiamine, and pantothenic acid or its derivatives are required by all strains. Arginine is not hydrolyzed by all species. Growth occurs at 15 °C, with some species growing at 42–45 °C. Cell-wall peptidoglycan is based on lysine as diamino acid, and, with the exception of Weissella kandleri, all contain alanine or alanine and serine in the interpeptide bridge. In addition, the interpeptide bridge of Weissella kandleri (Lys–L-Ala–Gly–L-Ala2) contains glycine (Holzapfel and van Wyk, 1 9 8 2). The phenotypic characteristics of Weissella spp. are listed in Table 128. DNA G+C content (mol%): 37–47 (T m and Bd).

Firmicutes / “Clostridia” / Clostridiales / “Lachnospiraceae” / Coprococcus Cocci that are Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, and obligately anaerobic chemoorganotrophs. All species in the genus are isolated from human feces (Moore and Holdeman, 1974) but rarely isolated from human clinical specimens. Strains were originally isolated on an anaerobically sterilized rumen-fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (Holdeman et al., 1977a) roll tube. However, pure cultured strains grow on anaerobically incubated blood agar plates (supplemented with brain heart infusion agar with 5% sheep blood). Cells may occur as pairs or chains of pairs. Cells of the some species are slightly elongated, in particular, when grown in medium containing fermentable carbohydrates. Fermentable carbohydrates are either required or are highly stimulatory for growth. Major fermentation products include butyric and acetic acids, with formic or propionic acid. Characteristics to differentiate species of the genus Coprococcus and biochemically closely related species of the Ruminococcus are given in Table 167. The genus phylogenetically belongs to family Lachnospiraceae and the phylogenetic position within the family is shown in Figure 1 (Ezaki et al., 1994; Rainey and Janssen, 1995; Willems and Collins, 1995a).

Syntrophomonas	Syn.tro.pho.mon'as. Gr. adj. syn together with; Gr. n. trophos one who feeds; Gr. n. monas a unit, monad; N.L. fem. n. Syntrophomonas monad which feeds together with (another species). Firmicutes / “Clostridia” / Clostridiales / Syntrophomonadaceae / Syntrophomonas Slightly helical rods, 0.5–1.0 by 2–7 µm, with slightly tapered rounded ends. Most cells occur singly or in pairs with helical chains of three or more. Multiplication is by binary fission. Cells possess 2–8 flagella (about 20 nm in diameter) that are inserted laterally in a linear fashion on the concave side of the cell, about 130 nm or more apart. Under most conditions, cells usually exhibit only sluggish twitching motility. Cells have an unusual multilayered cell wall that stains Gram-negative. Muramic and meso-diaminopimelic acids are present and the organism is susceptible to penicillin. Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate is present. Cells β-oxidize saturated fatty acids anaerobically with protons serving as the electron acceptors in co-cultures with a hydrogenotroph. Growth is much faster with Methanospirillum hungatei, which utilizes both H2 and formate, than with methanogens such as Methanobacterium bryantii that utilize only H2. In co-culture, cells produce acetate and H2 from butyrate and longer straight-chain, even-numbered-carbon fatty acids and acetate, propionate, and H2 from n-valerate and longer straight-chain, odd-numbered-carbon fatty acids. At least some strains produce acetate, isovalerate, and H2 from iso acids such as isoheptanoate and some strains produce acetate, propionate, and H2 from 2-methylbutyrate. It is possible, but has not yet been determined, that anteiso acids such as anteisooctanoate are degraded to acetate, anteisohexanoate, and H2. The strains studied so far can, with considerable difficulty, be adapted to grow slowly in axenic culture on crotonate, with acetate and butyrate as the products. Carbohydrates, proteinaceous materials, alcohols, and other organic compounds do not support growth. Common electron acceptors such as fumarate, malate, nitrate, oxygen, sulfate, sulfite, sulfur, and thiosulfate are not utilized with butyrate as the electron donor. Growth may be stimulated in co-cultures by factors in rumen fluid or mixtures of vitamins or both. Isolated as co-cultures from anaerobic ecosystems, such as aquatic sediments, sewage digester sludge, the rumen, and rice field mud, where organic matter is degraded, with CO2 and CH4 as major products. The temperature range for growth of co-cultures with Methanospirillum hungatei is in the broad mesophilic range, with an optimum of 30–37°C. Phylogenetically, as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the genus Syntrophomonas forms a deeply branched lineage in the bacteria related to the Firmicutes. DNA G+C content (mol%): 40–47.

Some strains can be adapted to grow in pure culture on crotonate with acetate and butyrate as major products. No other organic acids, sugars, or alcohols are utilized.

Thermoanaerobacter rod which grows in the absence of air at elevated temperatures. Firmicutes / “Clostridia” / Thermoanaerobacterales / Thermoanaerobacteraceae / Thermoanaerobacter All species are obligately anaerobic thermophiles and have a Gram-positive cell wall, i.e., although the Gram-stain reaction varies among the individual species and even within strains from the same species, they have a Gram-positive cell-wall structure. Most species exhibit a sluggish motility and a peritrichous arrangement of 2–6 flagella (retarded peritrichous flagellation). Cells are rod shaped and occur in various arrangements that vary by species. Many of the Thermoanaerobacter species form pleomorphic cells during the late exponential and stationary growth phases assembling through nonsymmetric cell division chains of alternating rod-shaped and coccoid cells. Other types of pleomorphic rods are formed, presumably through weakening of the cell wall by lysozyme-like enzymes that are the remnants of the sporulation process (Figure 1). Growth temperature optima range from 55–75 °C, with growth ranges of 35–78 °C and a temperature span over 35 °C. The pH for growth ranges from pH25C 4.0–9.9, with a pH optimum of 5.8–8.5. Several species also exhibit a wide pH optimum of about 3 units without a sharp peak. All species are able to grow organoheterotrophically using various fermentation pathways including the homoacetogenic or Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, or using inorganic electron acceptors (e.g., Thermoanaerobacter sulfuriphilus using S0 as an electron acceptor and lactate as an electron donor and carbon source). Some Thermoanaerobacter strains are also able to grow chemolithoheterotrophically by coupling H2 oxidation to growth (Fardeau et al., 1994). Furthermore, others are facultative chemolithoautotrophs, growing with H2 + CO2 (such as Thermoanaerobacter kivui) or Fe(III) + H2 + CO2 (such as Thermoanaerobacter siderophilus). Generally, typical fermentation products from hexoses are ethanol, acetate, lactate, H2, and CO2. DNA G+C content (mol%): 30–39.

Candidatus Magnetobacterium	Mag.ne' to.bac.te' ri.um. Gr. n. magnes magnet, comb. formmagneto-; Gr. n. bakterion a small rod; M.L. neut. n. Magnetobacterium a magnetic rod. Nitrospirae / “Nitrospira” / “Nitrospirales” / “Nitrospiraceae” / “Candidatus Magnetobacterium” Rod-shaped, large, magnetic cells occurring in freshwater sediments. The original description is based on bacteria enriched from the littoral sediment of a freshwater lake in Southern Germany (Chiemsee); similar types of bacteria were also observed in sediments of other freshwater lakes and ponds in Southern Germany and Brazil. Counts of active bacteria in different vertical layers of Chiemsee sediment indicated that “Candidatus M. bavaricum” is a typical gradient organism, particularly adapted to zones characterized by low levels of oxygen, where it reaches the highest abundance (Spring et al., 1993). A minor fraction of these bacteria was also found in the anoxic zone, whereas high concentrations of oxygen can apparently not be tolerated by this bacterium over longer periods of time.

Pirellula	Pi.rel'lu.la. L. n. pirum pear; L. fem. dim. ending -ella; L. fem. dim. ending -ula; N.L. fem. n. Pirellula very small pear, referring to the shape of the bacterium. Planctomycetes / Planctomycetia / Planctomycetales / Planctomycetaceae / Pirellula Pear or teardrop-shaped cells with one pointed attachment pole, 0.5–3.0 × 1.0–5.0 µm. Gram-stain-negative. Cells do not possess a stalk, but may form a fibrillar holdfast. Frequently form rosettes by attachment with the pointed cell pole. The holdfast occurs on one pole of the cell (the narrow pole of ovoid cells) and facilitates attachment to other cells to form rosettes. Crateriform structures are distributed at one pole only. Reproduction is solely by bud formation. Buds are formed at or near the opposite, wider pole which thus constitutes the reproductive pole. Newly formed buds are motile by polar to subpolar monotrichous flagella. When thin sectioned cells prepared via cryosubstitution are examined via electron microscopy, they display a characteristic organization including a major cell compartment, the pirellulosome, in which ribosomes and a condensed nucleoid are enclosed by an intracytoplasmic membrane, and a ribosome-free paryphoplasm region between this intracytoplasmic membrane and the closely apposed cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. Chemoorganotrophic; obligately aerobic. The original description was emended following the description of Rhodopirellula and Blastopirellula to include more recent data (Schlesner et al., 2004). The major polyamine is symhomospermidine. The major respiratory lipoquinone present is MK-6. The major phospholipid present is phosphatidylglycerol. A number of other lipids are present that have characteristic R f values, but whose structures are not currently known. The lipid pattern is characteristic.

Planctomycetes / Planctomycetia / Planctomycetales / Planctomycetaceae / Planctomyces Cells are spherical, ovoid, ellipsoidal, teardrop-shaped, or bulbiform. Often relatively large (ignoring appendages and aggregations, individual vegetative cells range up to 3.5 µm in greatest dimension; immature buds smaller). Have at least one major multifibrillar (nonprosthecate) appendage (called a spike, spire, fascicle, bristle, or stalk) which does not always have the true stalk function of connecting the cell to a substratum. Divide by budding. A holdfast-which is not always an easily visualized, discrete structure-is often present at the distal end of an appendage or at one end of the cell. Often form homologous aggregations, rosettes or bouquets, by attachment at the holdfasts in natural habitats. Produce crateriform surface structures (surface pits 12 nm in diameter, circumscribed by a grommet with a 30–36 nm outside diameter) and pili in characteristic patterns. Gram-stain-negative bacteria. Lack peptidoglycan. Resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. Divide by budding. Some species have a dimorphic life cycle: a sessile mother cell buds; the bud develops into a swarmer that is motile by means of a flagellum (often ensheathed); after maturation, the swarmer loses its flagellum and becomes a sessile, budding mother cell. All cultivated species are aerobes or facultative anaerobes. Occur worldwide in both eutrophic and oligotrophic freshwaters, as well as in estuarine and marine habitats. Sometimes become encrusted with iron and manganese oxides. Often associated in nature with algae and cyanobacteria. Although several species have now been isolated in pure culture, the type species and various other rosette-forming species have not been cultivated axenically. Carbohydrates are reported to be the main carbon source for cultivated members of the genus, which are relatively slow-growing. DNA G+C content (mol%): 50.5–57.7.

Asticcacaulis	A' stic.ca.cau' lis. Gr. alpha privative without; Anglo-Saxon n. sticca stick; L. n. caulis stalk; L. masc. n. Asticcacaulis stalk that does not stick. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Caulobacterales / Caulobacteraceae / Asticcacaulis Cells single, unbranched, rod-shaped, poles blunt or gently rounded; 0.5–0.7 × 1–3 µm during growth in most media. Some cells in any growing population have one subpolar or one or two lateral prosthecae. Each prostheca includes outer membrane, peptidoglycan, cell membrane, and a core sometimes observed to be occupied in part by membranes, but other cytoplasmic components cannot be discerned through most of its length. Beyond the cell–prostheca juncture, prostheca diameter is constant, 0.10–0.15 µm; each prostheca possesses at least one stalk band as a substructure after the cell has matured and completed at least one cell cycle. Other cells in the same population bear a single, subpolar flagellum. Each type of cell bears a small mass of adhesive material, the holdfast, at one pole; the holdfast site is not coincident with the site of the flagellum or of the prostheca(e). Binary fission occurs by septation, typically resulting in the production of a longer, prosthecate cell and a shorter, flagellated cell. Fission may occur in cells lacking prosthecae.

The younger pole of the dividing cell bears a single flagellum, and the older pole bears a prostheca (the stalk) developed by outgrowth of the cell envelope. The stalk includes outer membrane, peptidoglycan, cell membrane, and a core sometimes observed to be occupied in part by membranes but not in any case by any other discernible cytoplasmic components. Stalk diameter is constant along its length, varying from 0.11 to 0.18 µm among isolates; the stalk possesses at least one stalk band as a substructure after the cell has matured and completed at least one cell cycle. Binary fission is constrictive and is completed without formation of a septum. The stalk-bearing progeny cell grows and eventually repeats the asymmetric cell division. The flagellum-bearing progeny cell, after a period of motility, releases the flagellum and develops its stalk at the previously flagellated site as it grows and proceeds to its asymmetric cell division. At the base of the flagellum and at the outer tip of the stalk is a small mass of adhesive material, the holdfast, which confers adhesiveness on each of the progeny. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 62–65. Type species: Caulobacter vibrioides Henrici and Johnson 1935b, 84.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00792/abstract

Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Bartonellaceae / Bartonella Morphology is small (0.5–0.6 × 1.0 µm), slightly curved bacillus. Not acid-fast. Faintly stains Gram negative (stains poorly or not at all with many aniline dyes) but satisfactorily with Romanowsky's or Giemsa's stain. Warthin-Starry silver staining of fixed tissue sections reveals bacilli in clusters. May be seen in stained blood films appearing as rounded or ellipsoidal forms or as slender, straight, curved, or bent rods, occurring singly or in groups. They characteristically occur in chains of seve ral segmenting organisms, sometimes swollen at one or both ends and frequently beaded. In the tissues, they are situated within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells as isolated elements or are grouped in rounded masses. Intraerythrocytic forms occur in the blood of felines, small rodents, birds, fish, and other animals. In cultures, the cells may be very autoadherent. Some species possess unipolar flagella. The presence of pili is associated with the marked adherence and may mediate specific interaction with host endothelial cells and erythrocytes leading to intracellular localization.

Colonies are circular, opaque, rarely translucent, white, and convex, and tend to be granular in texture; they do not exceed 1.0 mm in diameter in less than 5–6 days incubation on A1EG medium. Turbidity develops only after 3–4 days in agitated broth. Generation times are 9–18 h. Chemoorganotrophic, utilizing a range of carbohydrates and salts of organic acids as carbon sources, without gas formation; arabinose and other pentoses are preferred carbon sources. Cellulose and starch are not utilized. Produce an alkaline reaction in mineral salts medium containing mannitol and/or many other carbohydrates. Growth on carbohydrate media is usually accompanied by extracellular polysaccharide slime production particularly with glycerol, gluconate, or mannitol.

Pedomicrobium	Pe.do.mi.cro' bi.um. Gr. n. pedon soil; Gr. adj. micros small; Gr. masc. n. bios life; M.L. neut. n. Pedomicrobium soil microbe. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Hyphomicrobiaceae / Pedomicrobium Cells oval, spherical, or rod-shaped, 0.4–2.0 × 0.4–2.5 µm. Up to 5 hyphae (i.e., cellular outgrowths or prosthecae of constant diameter with reproductive function) are formed per cell body. Hyphae are 0.15–0.2 µm in diameter. At least one hypha originates laterally; others may appear at the cell poles. Multiplication is by budding at the hyphal tips, with the long axis of the bud arranged perpendicular to the hyphal axis (Figures 1 and 2). Mature buds either separate from the hyphae as uniflagellated swarmers or remain attached. Extracellular polymers can be stained with ruthenium red and sometimes are visible in India ink mounts as thick capsules around mother cells. Oxidized iron or manganese compounds are deposited on mother cells and later on hyphae. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative, older cells variable. Swarmer cells are motile by a single subpolar or polar flagellum (Figure 3). Other stages of the cell cycle (Figure 4) are nonmotile. Colonies are yellowish or reddish brown to dark brown, due to accumulated iron or manganese oxides. Aerobic. Catalase positive (test is in absence of MnO2 and at neutral pH). Chemoorganotrophic. Acetate is utilized as a carbon source; most strains also grow on caproate or pyruvate. Protein digests, such as yeast extract, peptone, Casamino acids, and soytone, serve as carbon and/or nitrogen sources. Organic nitrogen sources utilized by most strains are glutamate, aspartate, glycine, serine, threonine, and valine. Inorganic nitrogen compounds allow only poor growth of some isolates; nitrate is reduced by most strains. Slow and poor growth occurs on agar media with 0.1–1% fulvic acid iron sesquioxide complexes as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Vitamin mixtures stimulate growth; lack of vitamins results in pleomorphic cells, which produce large granules of poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Growth is inhibited by polymyxin B and neomycin.

Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Hyphomicrobiaceae / Seliberia Rods, 0.5–0.8 µm in diameter and 1–12 µm in length, with a helically sculptured or furrowed topography. The ends of the cell may be either blunt or rounded. Stellate aggregates (rosettes) of sessile rods joined at one pole, and individual, shorter motile rods (swarmers) occur in the same culture.

Starkeya	Star.ke' ya. M.L. n. Starkeya of Starkey; named after Robert L. Starkey, who made important contributions to the study of soil microbiology and sulfur biochemistry. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Hyphomicrobiaceae / Starkeya Short rods, coccoidal or ellipsoidal cells 0.4–0.8 × 0.8–2.0 µm, occurring singly and, occasionally, in pairs. Nonmotile. Colonies grown on thiosulfate agar (with biotin) are small, smooth, circular, round, and opalescent, becoming white with sulfur. Thiosulfate liquid medium (lacking biotin) becomes turbid and sulfur precipitates during static incubation; thiosulfate is incompletely used, and the pH falls from 7.8 to 5.8. This poor development is due to the requirement for biotin exhibited by the type strain. The organism is facultatively chemolithoautotrophic, but optimal autotrophic development requires biotin, and optimal heterotrophic growth requires yeast extract, biotin, or other additions, such as pantothenate, depending on the organic substrate. Autotrophic growth is also observed with formate when high levels of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase are expressed. Some strains may degrade methylated sulfides. This organism is strictly aerobic, both autotrophically and heterotrophically, and is incapable of denitrification. Oxidizes and grows on thiosulfate and tetrathionate but not on sulfur or thiocyanate. Ammonium salts, nitrates, urea, and glutamate are used as nitrogen sources. Optimal temperature 25–30°C; growth range 10–37°C (no growth at 5°C or 42°C). Optimal pH 7.0; growth range pH 5.7–9.0. Contains ubiquinone Q-10. Major cellular fatty acids are octadecenoic acid and cyclopropane acid of C19; lacks a major hydroxy fatty acid. The lipopolysaccharide lacks heptoses and has only 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxyglucose as the backbone sugar. Member of the Alphaproteobacteria. Isolated from soil. Presumably widely distributed. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 67.3–68.4.

Xanthobacter	Xan.tho.bac' ter. Gr. adj. xanthos yellow; M.L. masc. n. bacter the equivalent of Gr. neut. n. bacterion rod, staff; M.L. masc. n. Xanthobacter yellow rod. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Hyphomicrobiaceae / Xanthobacter Cells are rod shaped, sometimes twisted, 0.4–1.0 × 0.8–6.0 µm. Pleomorphic cells are produced on media containing tricarboxylic cycle-intermediates (especially succinate), whereas coccoid cells as well as cells up to 10 µm long are produced on media containing an alcohol as the sole carbon source. Refractile (polyphosphate) and lipid (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate) bodies are evenly distributed in the cells. Resting stages are unknown. Key sporulation genes are absent. Depending on the species and growth conditions, the cells are nonmotile or motile (by peritrichous flagella). The Gram reaction frequently appears falsely to be positive or variable due to polyphosphate granules; however, ultrastructurally and biochemically, the cell wall is of the negative Gram-type.1Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Optimal temperature, 25–30°C. Optimal pH, 5.8–9.0. Colonies are opaque and slimy (although “slimeless” strains exist) and are yellow due to a water-insoluble carotenoid pigment (zeaxanthin dirhamnoside). The color intensity depends on the amount of slime produced by individual strains. Catalase positive. All strains can grow chemolithoautotrophically in mineral media under an atmosphere of H2, O2, and CO2 (7:2:1, v/v) as well as chemoorganoheterotrophically on methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and various organic acids as sole carbon sources. The carbohydrate utilization spectrum is limited, and neither volatile/ nonvolatile fatty acids nor gas is produced from carbohydrates such as fructose, glucose, or mannose. Some strains require vitamins. Some strains can utilize substituted thiophenes as sole carbon, energy, and sulfur sources. When degrading aliphatic epoxides, tested strains contain coenzyme M, which otherwise is a typical coenzyme of the obligate anaerobic methanogenic archaea. N2 is fixed in nitrogen-deficient media under heterotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic growth conditions, but by most strains only under a decreased O2 pressure. The bacteria occur free-living in freshwater (mainly X. agilis), wet soil containing decaying organic material (X. autotrophicus, X. flavus), marine sediments (X. flavus), compost of root balls of Tagetes (thiophenutilizing X. tagetidis), and associated with the roots of plants including wetland rice (X. flavus). Xanthobacter can be regarded an associative N2-fixing bacterium (rice, tagetis, coconut palm). The induction of root or stem nodules has not been observed. 16S rDNA sequence analysis places the members into the class Alphaproteobacteria; however, the presently recognized species of Xanthobacter are intermixed with the single-species genera Aquabacter and Azorhizobium, and together they form a distinct cluster.

Rhizobium	Rhi.zo' bi.um. Gr. n. rhiza a root; Gr. n. bios life; M.L. neut. n. Rhizobium that which lives in a root. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rhizobiales / Rhizobiaceae / Rhizobium Rods 0.5–1.0 × 1.2–3.0 µm. Nonsporeforming. Gram negative. Motile by 1–6 peritrichous flagella. Fimbriae have been described on some strains. Aerobic, possessing a respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Optimal temperature for growth, 25–30°C; some species can grow at temperatures >40°C. Optimal pH for growth, 6–7; range pH 4–10. Generation times of Rhizobium strains are 1.5–5.0 h. Colonies are usually white or beige, circular, convex, semi-translucent or opaque, raised and mucilaginous, usually 2–4 mm in diameter within 3–5 days on yeast-mannitol-mineral salts agar (YMA). Growth on carbohydrate media is usually accompanied by copious amounts of extracellular polysaccharide. Pronounced turbidity develops after 2 or 3 days in aerated or agitated broth. Chemoorganotrophic, utilizing a wide range of carbohydrates and salts of organic acids as sole carbon sources, without gas formation. Cellulose and starch are not utilized. Produce an acidic reaction in mineral-salts medium containing mannitol or other carbohydrates. Ammonium salts, nitrate, nitrite, and most amino acids can serve as nitrogen sources. Strains of some species will grow in a simple mineral salts medium with vitamin-free casein hydrolysate as the sole source of both carbon and nitrogen, but strains of many species require one or more growth factors such as biotin, pantothenate, or nicotinic acid. Peptone is poorly utilized. Casein, starch, chitin, and agar are not hydrolyzed. All known Rhizobium species include strains which induce hypertrophisms in plants as root nodules with or without symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Some cells of symbiotic bacterial species enter root hair cells of leguminous plants (Family Leguminosae) via invagination or by wounds (“crack entry”) and elicit the production of root nodules wherein the bacteria engage as intracellular symbionts, usually fixing nitrogen. Many well-defined nodulation (nod) and nitrogen fixation (nif) genes are clustered on large plasmids or megaplasmids (pSyms). Plasmid transfer between species results in the expression and stable inheritance of the particular plant-interactive properties of the plasmid-donor species. Plant host specificity is usually for a few legume genera but may, in some strains, include a wide variety of legume genera and is to some extent determined by the chemical structure of the lipochito-oligosaccharide Nod factors produced. These chitin-like molecules induce nodule organogenesis in the absence of bacteria. In root nodules the bacteria occur as endophytes that exhibit pleomorphic forms, termed “bacteroids”, which reduce or fix gaseous atmospheric nitrogen into a combined form utilizable by the host plant. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 57–66.

L. n. caedes act of killing; M.L. masc. n. bacter the masculine equivalent of the Gr. neut. n. bactrum a rod; masc. n. caedibacter the bacterium which kills. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rickettsiales / Holosporaceae / incertae Sedis II. Caedibacter Straight rods or coccobacilli 0.4–1.0 × 1.0–4.0 µm. Gram negative, nonflagellated, nonmotile. Intracellular (endosymbiotic) bacteria in Paramecium. Culture free of Paramecium impossible or exceedingly difficult. The ability to produce refractile inclusion (R) bodies was seen as a unique feature of the genus. R bodies are proteinaceous ribbons, approximately 10 µm long, coiled inside the bacterial cell (Figures 1, 2, and 3). The hollow cylindrical structure formed may be 0.4–0.8 µm long and about 0.4 µm in diameter. R bodies unroll when ingested into a phagosome and under certain in vitro conditions (for details see Preer et al., 1974; Quackenbush, 1988; Pond et al., 1989). R bodies are associated with spherical phage-like structures or covalently closed circular DNA plasmids. All species are toxic to certain sensitive strains of paramecia; bacteria confer killer-trait or mate killer-trait upon their host cells. An exception is “C. macronucleorum” from Paramecium duboscqui, where no toxic effects were observed. Cells containing R bodies are usually larger than cells that do not contain R bodies, and contain many spherical phage-like structures of covalently closed, circular, DNA plasmids. Recently, a symbiotic bacterium from Acanthamoeba was included in the genus Caedibacter because of its sequence similarity to Caedibacter caryophilus (Horn et al., 1999). This new Caedibacter species, Candidatus Caedibacter acanthamoebae, does not establish R bodies. Also interesting is the relatively close relationship of Caedibacter to the genus Holospora and to the “NHP bacterium”, etiologic agent of necrotizing hepatopancreatitis in shrimp (Loy et al., 1996; Horn et al., 1999). The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 34–44.

Whether lacking the ability to produce R bodies justifies separation of the genus Pseudocaedibacter from the genus Caedibacter may be questioned because the newly found endosymbiont from Acanthamoeba polyphaga, Candidatus Caedibacter acanthamoebae, does not establish R bodies but showed 93% sequence similarity (16S rRNA) to Caedibacter caryophilus and was therefore included in the genus Caedibacter (Horn et al., 1999).

Orientia	O' ri.en' ti.a. M.L. fem. n. Orientia pertaining to the Orient, the area where the organisms are widely distributed. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rickettsiales / Rickettsiaceae / Orientia Short rods 0.5–0.8 × 1.2–3.0 µm. Obligately intracellular. Grow free in the cytosol of the host cell; rarely invade the nucleus. Bacterial cells are released surrounded by host cell membrane. Cell walls lack lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. The outer leaflet of the cell wall is considerably thicker than the inner leaflet, unlike the wall of rickettsiae. The genome of Orientia is 1.1–1.5 × 109 Da, larger than that of Rickettsia. Maintained by transovarian transmission in its various trombiculid mite hosts. Etiological agents of scrub typhus in humans. Transmitted to humans by mite larvae. Found in Asia and Australia. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 28.1–30.5 (HPLC). Type species: Orientia tsutsugamushi (Hayashi 1920) Tamura, Ohashi, Urakami and Miyamura 1995, 590 (Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Hayashi 1920) Ogata 1931, 252; “Theileria tsutsugamushi” Hayashi 1920, 63.)	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00915/abstract
Rickettsia	Rick.ett' si.a. M.L. fem. n. Rickettsia named after Howard Taylor Ricketts, who first associated organisms of this description with spotted fever and typhus and who died of typhus contracted in the course of his studies. Proteobacteria / Alphaproteobacteria / Rickettsiales / Rickettsiaceae / Rickettsia Short, often paired rods, 0.3–0.5 × 0.8–2.0 μm. The rickettsial envelope has a typical Gram-negative structure with a bilayer inner membrane, a peptidoglycan layer, and a bilayer outer membrane. The cells are often surrounded by a protein microcapsular layer and slime layer. Rickettsiae retain basic fuchsin when stained by the method of Giménez (1964). The organisms are obligately intracellular and reside free in the cytoplasm of the eucaryotic host cell, where they divide by binary fission. Rickettsiae of the spotted fever group (SFG) may also reside in the nucleus of the eucaryotic host cells. Rickettsiae are closely associated with arthropods (ticks, mites, fleas, lice, and other insects) for their maintenance in nature. Their natural cycle usually involves both a vertebrate and an invertebrate host. For some, the arthropod host is both a reservoir and a vector. Transovarian transmission of the agent from the infected female to the next generation is the essential mechanism for the maintenance of many species (Burgdorfer, 1988). Rickettsial cells are usually unstable when separated from host components, except for highly stable forms found in the feces of arthropod hosts; stability can be enhanced by certain proteins, sucrose, and reagents that tend to maintain the integrity of outer membranes, osmolarity, and ATP level. Rickettsiae are best preserved by rapid freezing and storage below −50°C. The cells are rapidly inactivated at 56°C. Rickettsiae derive energy from the metabolism of glutamate via the citric acid cycle, but do not utilize glucose. They transport and metabolize phosphorylated compounds but do not synthesize or degrade nucleoside monophosphates. Rickettsiae are etiological agents of typhus and spotted fevers in humans. There are 21 recognized species. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 29–33. Type species: Rickettsia prowazekii da Rocha-Lima 1916, 567 (Nom. Cons. Opin. 19, Jud.

Definite capsules are not evident. No resting stages known. Gram negative. Motile by means of both a single polar flagellum and usually one or more subpolar or lateral flagella. Facultative anaerobes. Grow on ordinary peptone media. On low-nutrient media, such as nutrient agar containing a quarter of the normal concentration of nutrients, colonies are usually very thin, with rough surfaces and irregular edges, and may spread to 1 cm or more in diameter; they are of butyrous consistency and are easily emulsified in water. Most strains produce the violet pigment violacein, and this shows most intensely in the centers of spreading colonies, but strains producing nonpigmented colonies (which are easily overlooked) are sometimes encountered. Occasional strains may spread only poorly and may even produce slightly gelatinous colonies, whose appearances are reminiscent of those produced by Chromobacterium and Janthinobacterium species. On full-strength nutrient agar and other routine, richer media, colonies may show less tendency to spread. Growth in quarter-strength nutrient broth is moderate after 24 h at 25°C, with uniform turbidity and a violet ring at the surface, but no pellicle; strains that produce long filaments may appear to gel in broths. Chemoorganotrophs; attack carbohydrates fermentatively, producing small amounts of acid, but no gas. Grow at 4–30°C, with optimal growth at ~25°C. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 50–52.

Prolinoborus	Pro.li.no' bo.rus. L. n. prolina the amino acid proline; Gr. adj. boros voracious M.L. masc. n. Prolinoborus (bacteria) that readily consume proline. Proteobacteria / Betaproteobacteria / Neisseriales / Neisseriaceae / Prolinoborus Straight rods, 0.7–0.9 μm in width. Cells are approximately 5–10 µm in length, but old cultures may contain cells up to 42 µm long. Curved or S-shaped variants have been reported to occur in one strain after prolonged serial transfer. A polar membrane underlies the cytoplasmic membrane. Intracellular poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules are present in the rods. Extensive conversion of the rod-shaped cells to round forms (“coccoid bodies”) occurs in older cultures. Upon initial isolation, the cells form highly viscous flocs, within which the cells swim steadily in straight lines. The floc-forming ability is gradually lost during subsequent serial transfers, and the growth eventually becomes turbid. Cells have bipolar flagellar fascicles composed of up to 11 flagella. The fascicles can be seen clearly by dark-field microscopy and show unusual and distinctive behavior when the cells are suspended in ordinary, nonviscous media: helical wave propagation with waves progressing from base to tip, an ability to coil up like springs, and basal bending accompanied by a change in wavelength. In such nonviscous media the cells do not swim; instead, they exhibit an ineffectual “floundering about” movement; however, when they are suspended in a medium of high viscosity (10–200 centipoise, obtained by the use of agents such as DNA or methylcellulose “400 centipoise”), they swim steadily in straight lines. Optimal temperature, 30°C; no growth at 20°C or 40°C. Catalase and oxidase positive. Carbohydrates are not catabolized. Pyruvate and proline are the most effective sole carbon sources. Proline can be used a sole source of nitrogen and carbon. Nitrogenase activity (ability to reduce acetylene) occurs under microaerobic conditions. Habitat: pond water.

Nitrosomonas	Ni.tro.so.mo' nas. M.L. adj. nitrosus nitrous; Gr. fem. n. monas a unit, monad; M.L. fem. n. Nitrosomonas nitrite monad, i.e., the monad producing nitrite. Proteobacteria / Betaproteobacteria / Nitrosomonadales / Nitrosomonadaceae / Nitrosomonas Spherical, ellipsoidal, or rod-shaped cells (Figures 1–3, and 4). Strains belonging to the same species are generally very similar in the shape and size of their cells. Cells occur singly or occasionally in short chains. Depending on the growth conditions, cells are free-living or embedded in slimy aggregates. Gram-negative cell wall, but some marine representatives show an additional outer cell-wall layer composed of subunits arranged in a macromolecular array (Watson and Remsen, 1969). Motile cells possess polar flagella. Intracytoplasmic membranes are arranged as flattened vesicles, primarily in the peripheral cytoplasm (Figures 1–3, and 4). Carboxysomes (Figure 5) are present in some species. Urea can be used as ammonia source by many, but not all, species. The Ks values for oxidation of NH3 range between 0.6 and 158 μM. Most, if not all, species are predominantly or exclusively present in special environments. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 45–54 (Tm).

Proteobacteria / Betaproteobacteria / Nitrosomonadales / Nitrosomonadaceae / Nitrosospira Cells are tightly coiled spirals (Figure 1a), 0.3–0.4 µm in width, with 3–20 turns. Occasionally, vibrioid cells occur in cultures. By phase-microscopy, spherical forms 0.8–1.2 µm in diameter may be observed in cultures. Gram-negative cell wall. Intracytoplasmic membranes are rare (Figure 1b), but tubular invaginations are observed. Motile strains possess peritrichous flagella. 1–6 flagella are observed, each 3–5 µm in length. Urease-positive strains, as well as urease-negative strains, exist in all species. Common in grasslands, heath, forest soils, and mountainous environments. Some strains have been isolated from building stones and from acid soils (pH 4.0–4.5). Occasionally observed in freshwater environments. Using molecular ecological methods, the existence of Nitrosospira-like groups in marine environment has repeatedly been indicated (Stephen et al., 1996; Phillips et al., 1999; Bano and Hollibaugh, 2000). However this has not yet been proven via isolation of strains. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 53.2–55.4.

Azoarcus	A.zo' ar.cus. Fr. n. azote nitrogen; L. masc. n. arcus arch, bow; M.L. masc. n. Azoarcus nitrogen (-fixing) bow. Proteobacteria / Betaproteobacteria / Rhodocyclales / Rhodocyclaceae / Azoarcus Straight to slightly curved rods, 0.4–1.5 × 1.1–4.0 μm. Cell pairs often appear slightly S-shaped. In most species, some elongated cells (8–12 µm) occur in late-log or stationary-phase cultures on medium containing malic acid and N2 or ammonium as nitrogen source. Cells are highly motile by means of one polar flagellum. Accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules. Gram negative. Some species are nitrogen fixers; these require microaerobic conditions for growth on N2. On semisolid nitrogen-free media, microaerophilic growth can be observed as veil-like pellicles developing several mm below the surface and moving to the medium surface during growth. In most species, colonies on VM agar1 supplemented with ethanol develop a nondiffusible yellowish pigment. Optimal temperature for growth 30–40°C; no growth occurs at 45°C. Chemoorganoheterotrophic. Bacteria have a strictly respiratory metabolism with O2 as the terminal electron acceptor, except one species. Alternatively, under anaerobic conditions, nitrate can be used for dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Oxidase positive. Grow well on salts of organic acids such as L-malate, succinate, fumarate, DL-lactate; also grow well on ethanol, on L-glutamate, but not on mono- or disaccharides except for species that are not plant-associated. These soil-borne species utilize a variety of aromatic substrates as sole carbon sources under denitrifying conditions. Nitrate can be used as a nitrogen source (assimilatory nitrate reduction). Growth factor requirements vary: some strains depend on p-aminobenzoic acid or on cobalamine. All investigated species have C16:1 cellular fatty acids; all species except one have C16:1 ω7c and C18:1 as the major cellular fatty acids. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 62–68 (Tm).

Zoogloea	Zo.o.gloe' a. Gr. adj. zoos living; Gr. n. gloia glue; M.L. fem. n. Zoogloea living glue. Proteobacteria / Betaproteobacteria / Rhodocyclales / Rhodocyclaceae / Zoogloea The following description is representative of the genus based on well-characterized isolates recovered directly from naturally occurring, typical, fingered zoogloeae: Straight to slightly curved, plump rods, 1.0–1.3 × 2.1–3.6 µm, with rounded ends; sometimes tapered to a blunt point at one or both poles. Nonsporeforming and noncystforming. Cells in older cultures are demonstrably encapsulated. Gram negative. Actively motile, especially in young cultures, by means of a single polar flagellum. Intracellular granules of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate are formed on media containing the salts of organic acids. Cultures enter into formation of flocs and films in liquid media at late growth stages; the cells become embedded in gelatinous matrices to form zoogloeae, which may be distinguished by a “tree-like” or “finger-like” morphology. Young colonies on solid media under a normal air atmosphere are translucent and punctiform, but may increase to 1 or 2 mm in diameter and exhibit opaque centers. Nonpigmented. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen or nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Denitrification occurs with formation of N2. Optimal temperature for growth, 28–37°C. Optimal pH, 7.0–7.5. Oxidase positive. Weakly catalase positive. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is not formed from carbohydrates except for xylose, glycerol, and ethanol, which are attacked oxidatively by a few strains. Proteolytic on gelatin. Most strains are urease positive. Litmus milk is unchanged. Hydrogen sulfide is usually not produced from cysteine. Major carbon sources include salts of several organic acids (e.g., lactate, pyruvate, and fumarate), dicarboxylic amino acids (e.g., aspartate, glutamate, and asparagine), alcohols, and salts of certain aromatic acids (e.g., benzoate and m-toluate). Benzene derivatives are attacked by meta cleavage of the ring structure. Organic nitrogen compounds (e.g., dicarboxylic amino acids) and ammonia serve as nitrogen sources; nitrate is unsuitable. Specific growth factor requirements, if any, are unknown. Major cellular fatty acids are palmitoleic (C16:1) and 3-hydroxydecanoic (C10:0 3OH) acids. Major respiratory quinones are Q-8 and RQ-8. The major polyamine is 2-hydroxyputrescine. Occur free-living in organically polluted fresh waters and in wastewaters at all stages of treatment. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 67.3–69.0.

Prey-independent mutants that have lost their requirement for prey cells occur spontaneously and can be isolated in the laboratory. Some of these prey-independent mutants retain the ability to grow predaciously and are considered to be facultative with respect to their requirement for prey cells.

Proteobacteria / Deltaproteobacteria / Bdellovibrionales / Bdellovibrionaceae / Micavibrio Curved rods 0.25–0.4 × 0.5–1.0 μm. Occur singly. Motile by a single, sheathless, polar flagellum approximately 13–15 nm in diameter. Gram negative. Electron microscopy demonstrates the cell wall infrastructure to be consistent with Gram-negative bacteria (Lambina et al., 1982). Exoparasitic on other bacteria. Attach themselves to their bacterial prey by the end opposite the flagellum and position themselves parallel to the longitudinal axis of the prey cell. They remain along the outside of the prey cell (unlike the genus Bdellovibrio, which penetrates its prey). After attachment, the cells lose their motility, multiply by binary fission, and eventually cause lysis of their prey cell. The organisms have an obligate requirement for prey cells for multiplication and lack the ability to propagate themselves on nutrient rich media. Initial prey susceptibility appears to be specific for members of the genus Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas , with different Micavibrio species having different prey requirements.

Gram negative. The type species is motile. Strict anaerobe with respiratory type of metabolism. Chemoorganotroph, using formate, butyrate, and higher fatty acids as electron donors and carbon sources; these compounds are completely oxidized to CO2. Growth on acetate and propionate is very slow.

Growth does not usually occur in the absence of an external electron acceptor. Optimal temperature for growth, 35–39°C. Anoxic media (with sulfide as a reductant) are necessary for growth. Vitamins are not required. Cells contain cytochromes of the b- and c-type. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity is commonly observed, indicating the operation of the anaerobic C1-pathway (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway, Woodpathway) for CO2 fixation and complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA.

Sulfate, and usually sulfite and thiosulfate, serve as terminal electron acceptors and are reduced to H2S. Sulfur and nitrate are not used as terminal electron acceptors. Fermentative growth has not been observed. Desulfoviridin is absent, but desulforubidin is present in some species. The major menaquinone is MK-7. Growth occurs in simple defined media containing sulfide as a reductant. Most species require vitamins. Many members of this genus can fix N2. The addition of ≥7 g NaCl and ≥1 g MgCl2·6H2O per liter medium is usually stimulatory or required for growth. The optimal temperature range for growth is 28–34°C. Thermophilic species have not been described. The optimal pH range for growth is 6.5–7.4. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity is absent.

Hydrogen sulfide is produced from sulfur-containing amino acids, but the organisms do not reduce sulfur. In the presence of formate, B. wadsworthia utilizes taurine as an electron acceptor, oxidizing it to acetate with the reduction of sulfonate sulfur to sulfide. Strongly catalase positive (when tested with 15% H2O2). Approximately 75–90% of strains produce urease, depending on the test system. (Claros et al., 1999).

All members of the genus Desulfovibrio contain desulfoviridin. Hydrogenase is usually present. Strains of some species may show chemolithoheterotrophic growth, using H2 as electron donor and assimilating acetate and CO2, or yeast extract, as carbon sources. Gelatin is not liquefied. Nitrate is sometimes reduced to ammonia. Some species can reduce oxygen or metal ions, but growth has never been observed with these electron acceptors in pure cultures. Molecular nitrogen is sometimes fixed. Species generally show some degree of antigenic cross reaction.

Proteobacteria / Deltaproteobacteria / Myxococcales / Cystobacteraceae / Cystobacter The history of the genus Cystobacter and the problems associated with its recognition are discussed above in the introduction to the family. The fruiting body shape and structure of Cystobacter is similar to fruiting bodies produced by Polyangium, Sorangium, Byssophaga, Jahnia, Pyxicoccus, and to a certain extent, Stigmatella hybrida. The genus as it is presented here still is heterogeneous and probably comprises at least three different genera. One group of species, with Cystobacter fuscus as the main representative, has slender, often slightly C- or S-shaped bent, rod-shaped myxospores with more or less tapering ends. Many strains of this group are efficient chitin degraders. The second group, represented by Cystobacter disciformis, has myxospores that are stout, short, fat rods, very much like myxospores of Archangium gephyra. These organisms rarely attack chitin. A third group, centered around Cystobacter gracilis, has delicate vegetative cells with tapering ends, and small myxospores that are straight or slightly bent rods with rounded ends. Analysis of the available 16S rRNA sequences separates at least the first two groups rather neatly (Spröer et al., 1999).

Helicobacter	He.li.co.bac' ter. Gr. n. helix a spiral; M.L. masc. n. bacter a staff; M.L. masc. n. Helicobacter a spiral rod. Proteobacteria / Epsilonproteobacteria / Campylobacterales / Helicobacteraceae / Helicobacter Cells may be curved, spiral, or fusiform rods, 0.2–1.2 × 1.5–10.0 µm. Spiral cells may be tightly or loosely wound depending on the species, and on the age and condition of the culture examined. Cells in old cultures or those exposed to air become coccoid. Ultrastructural studies show that periplasmic fibers may be observed on the cell surface of a few taxa and an electrondense glycocalyx- or capsule-like layer has been observed on the cell surface of some species. Nonsporeforming. Gram negative. Motile with a rapid corkscrew- or slower wave-like motion due to flagellar activity. Multiple sheathed flagella are seen in most species, frequently with a bipolar distribution. Typical cell morphologies of various Helicobacter species are shown in Figs. BXII.ε.5 and BXII.ε.6.

Thiovulum	Thi.o' vu.lum. Gr. n. thios sulfur; L. n. ovum egg; M.L. neut. dim. n. Thiovulum small sulfur egg. Proteobacteria / Epsilonproteobacteria / Campylobacterales / Helicobacteraceae / Thiovulum Cells are round to ovoid, 5–25 μm in diameter. Cytoplasm is often concentrated at one end of the cell, with the remaining space being occupied by a large vacuole. Cytoplasm normally contains orthorhombic sulfur inclusions, which are generally concentrated at one end and often almost filling cells completely (Figure 1). The amount of sulfur present in the cells varies with the H2S supply, and cells may be temporarily fully devoid of sulfur inclusions. The number of greenish bodies (up to 5 μm in diameter), thought to be storage material, increases with decreasing numbers of sulfur globules (Hinze, 1913). Cells are rapidly motile by peritrichous flagella (Figure 2; de Boer et al., 1961). Swimming velocity of over 600 μm s -1 , some of the highest recorded in the bacterial world (Garcia-Pichel, 1989). Forward movement is accompanied by rotation around the long axis. Unlike most motile bacteria, Thiovulum cells do swim backwards or tumble. Cells possess a fibrillar, or antapical organelle at the posterior end of the cell. Its function is to secrete a slime stalk or thread (Figure 2) which is used by cells to attach to solid surfaces. No resting stages are known. Type species: Thiovulum majus Hinze 1913, 195.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01074/abstract

Vibrio	Vib' ri.o. L. v. vibrio move rapidly back and forth, vibrate; M.L. masc. n. Vibrio the vibrating, darting organism. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / “Vibrionales” / Vibrionaceae / Vibrio Small, straight, slightly curved, curved, or comma-shaped rods, 0.5–0.8 × 1.4–2.6 µm. Involution forms often occur in old cultures and are formed under adverse growth conditions. Do not form endospores or microcysts. Gram negative. In liquid media, motile by monotrichous or multitrichous polar flagella enclosed in a sheath continuous with the outer membrane of the cell wall. On solid media, some species synthesize numerous lateral flagella with a wavelength shorter than that of the sheathed polar flagellum. Facultative anaerobes capable of both fermentative and respiratory metabolism. Molecular oxygen is a universal electron acceptor. Most do not denitrify or fix molecular nitrogen. All are chemoorganotrophs; most are able to grow in a mineral medium containing D-glucose as the sole carbon source and NH +as the sole nitrogen source. A few strains have organic growth factor requirements. Na4 +stimulates growth of all species and is an absolute requirement for most; the minimal concentration necessary for optimal growth ranges from 5 to 700 mM (0.029–4.1%). Most species grow well in media containing a seawater base. All ferment D-glucose producing acid but rarely gas; several species produce acetoin and acetyl methyl carbinol (positive Voges–Proskauer test). Most ferment and utilize D-fructose, maltose, and glycerol; are oxidase positive and reduce nitrate to nitrite. Several grow at 4°C; all grow at 20°C; most grow at 30°C; many grow at 35–37°C. A few species are bioluminescent, as are a few strains of normally nonluminescent species. Primarily aquatic; species distribution is usually dependent on Na+ and nutrient content of the water as well as its temperature. Very common in marine and estuarine environments and on the surfaces and in the intestinal contents of marine animals. Species with a low Na+ requirement are also found in freshwater habitats. Twelve species occur in human clinical specimens; 11 of these are apparently pathogenic for humans, causing diarrhea or extraintestinal infections.

Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Enterobacteriales / Enterobacteriaceae / Morganella Straight rods, 0.6–0.7 × 1.0–1.7 µm. Gram negative. Motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Facultatively anaerobic. Oxidative deamination of various amino acids including L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan (Singer and Volcani, 1955). Urease positive. Indole positive (Penner, 1984). Relatively few carbohydrates fermented. Ornithine decarboxylase positive. Acid produced from D-mannose but not D-xylose. Gelatin not degraded. The genus Morganella presently resides in the class Gammaproteobacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae, based upon DNA hybridization data and not rDNA sequencing (Stackebrandt et al., 1988). 16S rDNA sequence data are presently unavailable. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 50 (Falkow et al., 1962).

Obesumbacterium	O.be' sum.bac.te' ri.um. L. neut. adj. obesum fat; L. neut. n. bacterium rod; M.L. neut. n. Obesumbacterium a fat, rod-shaped bacterium. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Enterobacteriales / Enterobacteriaceae / Obesumbacterium Pleomorphic rods 0.8–2.0 × 1.5–100 μm (short, “fat” rods predominate when grown in beer wort with live yeasts; long pleomorphic rods usually predominate when grown in most bacteriological media; some strains have been reported to display a branching cell morphology), conforming to the general definition of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Gram negative. Nonmotile. Facultatively anaerobic. Slow growing, forming colonies <0.5 mm in diameter on ordinary plating media at 24 h. Optimal growth temperature is 25–32°C; growth at 37°C is comparatively poor. Acid formed from D-glucose and D-mannose; very few other carbohydrates are fermented. Gas formation during fermentation appears to be variable (original description says gas is produced, but none of the strains studied produced gas). Lysine decarboxylase is positive. Nitrate is reduced to nitrite. Many biochemical tests normally used for differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae are negative or delayed positive (3–7 d at 36°C). One of only three genera (along with Hafnia and Pragia) in Enterobacteriaceae to contain only gluconate dehydrogenase in its D-glucose oxidation pathway (Bouvet et al., 1989). Occurs as a brewery contaminant that can survive and grow in the presence of live yeasts during beer production. Not isolated from human clinical specimens; no evidence of pathogenicity for humans or animals. The genus has a single species, O. proteus, with two defined biogroups (1 and 2). The description of the genus above is a “composite description” based on data for both biogroups. However, the two biogroups are actually distinct species that are phenotypically different and only distantly related by DNA–DNA hybridization (Brenner, 1981). O. proteus biogroup 1 is actually a biogroup of Hafnia alvei (Brenner, 1981), and will be referred to as H. alvei biogroup 1 (Farmer et al., 1985a) in this chapter. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 48–49.

Photorhabdus	Pho.to.rhab' dus. Gr. n. photo light; Gr. fem. n. rhabdus rod; M.L. masc. n. Photorhabdus bioluminescent rod-shaped bacterium. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Enterobacteriales / Enterobacteriaceae / Photorhabdus Asporogenous rod-shaped cells 0.5–2 × 1–10 μm. Cell size is highly variable within and between cultures with occasional filaments up to 30 µm long. In the last stage of exponential growth and during stationary growth period, spheroplasts may occur with an average of 2.6 μm in diameter (10–20% of cell population), resulting from the partial disintegration of the cell wall. Proteinaceous protoplasmic inclusions are synthesized inside a high proportion of cells (50–80%) during the stationary period. Gram negative, motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Facultatively anaerobic, having both a respiratory and a fermentative type of metabolism. Optimum growth temperature usually ∼28°C; some strains grow at 37–38°C. Most strains produce pink, red, orange, yellow, or green pigmented colonies on nutrient agar, and especially on rich media (tryptic soy agar, egg yolk agar). Bioluminescent, usually detectable by the dark-adapted eye; intensity varies within and between isolates and may only be detectable by photometer or scintillation counter in some isolates; only very few nonluminescent isolates have been reported. Spontaneous phase shift occurs in subcultures inducing the appearance of phase II clones characterized by the loss of neutral red adsorption on MacConkey agar, of production of antibiotics, and of some other properties usually exhibited by wild clones freshly isolated from the natural environment and named phase I variants. Catalase positive. Do not reduce nitrate. Negative for oxidase, o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), Voges–Proskauer, arginine dihydrolase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylase tests. Proteolytic for gelatin. Most strains hemolytic for sheep and/or horse blood, some producing an unusual annular hemolysis on sheep blood at 25°C (Figure 1). Lipolytic activity on Tween 20; many strains lipolytic for Tweens 40, 60, 80, and/or 85. Acid production from glucose without gas. Acid produced from fructose, D-mannose, maltose, ribose, and N-acetylglucosamine; weak for acid production from glycerol. Fumarate, glucosamine, L-glutamate, L-malate, L-proline, succinate, and L-tyrosine are utilized as sole carbon and energy sources. Biochemical identification of Photorhabdus within the family Enterobacteriaceae is summarized in Table 1. Sequence analyses of 16S rDNA show that all Photorhabdus strains branch deeply within the radiation of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and have a specific TGAAAG sequence at positions 208–213 (E. coli numbering). The natural habitat for most strains is the intestinal lumen of entomopathogenic nematodes of the genus Heterorhabditis and insects infected by these nematodes. However, some nonsymbiotic strains have been identified as opportunistic pathogens for humans, not nematodes. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 43–45.

Gram negative. Motile by peritrichous flagella. They are facultatively anaerobic, chemoorganotrophic, having both a respiratory and a fermentative type metabolism. Optimal growth temperature is 37°C. Oxidatively deaminate phenylalanine and tryptophan. Acid is produced from D-mannose. All except Providencia rustigianii produce acid from one or more of the following polyhydric alcohols: inositol, D-mannitol, adonitol, D-arabitol, and erythritol. Except for Providencia heimbachae all are indole positive. Tartrate (Jordan) is utilized by all but a few strains of P. heimbachae. Simmons citrate is utilized by all species except P. heimbachae and some strains of P. rustigianii.

DNA relatedness tests have shown that Providencia are more closely related to Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis than to other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Although 16S RNA sequence data are not available for the Providencia species, the close relationship of Providencia to Proteus indicates that Providencia, like Proteus, belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria within the family Enterobacteriaceae.

Negative for lysine and ornithine decarboxylases and for arginine dihydrolase. Most strains are (weakly) positive for phenylalanine deaminase (after 48 h), methyl red, and Voges–Proskauer reaction. Acids are produced from various carbohydrates, including L-arabinose, cellobiose, lactose, maltose, mannose, l -rhamnose, raffinose, d -xylose, and salicin. Sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA of four Rahnella strains clearly placed the genus within the Gammaproteobacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Highest 16S rDNA sequence similarity to Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 9610T (97.7%). By omitting the hypervariable regions VI and V5 (corresponding to E. coli base positions 147–1490; Brosius et al., 1978), Hafnia alvei ATCC 13337T showed the highest sequence similarity (96.63%) to R. aquatilis ATCC 33071T. Most often isolated from fresh water, but also found in the intestine of snails and various other environmental habitats, including soils and the rhizosphere. Can occasionally be isolated from foods or human clinical specimens, including wound infections, bacteremias, feces from patients with acute gastroenteritis, and septicemia, especially from immunocompromised patients. The genus currently includes three genomospecies (R. aquatilis [Rahnella genomospecies 1], Rahnella genomospecies 2, and Rahnella genomospecies 3), which cannot be phenotypically differentiated.

Wigglesworthia	Wigg.les.worth' i.a. M.L. fem. n. Wigglesworthia named after the parasitologist W.B. Wigglesworth. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Enterobacteriales / Enterobacteriaceae / Wigglesworthia Obligate intracellular, bacteriome-tissue associated, primary endosymbionts of tsetse flies. In the adult fly, the bacteria lie free in the cytoplasm of differentiated epithelial cells, bacteriocytes, which form the U-shaped bacteriome organ (previously referred to as mycetome) in the anterior midgut (Figs. 1A, 1B). The endosymbionts are rod shaped (2–4 × 8–10 µm) with a typical Gram-negative cell wall and inner membrane structure, lack flagella (Fig. 1C). The cells appear to divide by binary fission. The bacteria are obligate intracellular organisms, as their experimental elimination from tsetse by procaryotic-specific antibiotic treatment, by lysozyme, or with symbiont-specific antibodies provided in the blood meal results in retarded growth of the insect and a decrease in egg production, causing loss of the ability of these aposymbiotic hosts to reproduce (Hill et al., 1973; Nogge, 1976, 1978, 1980). In addition to Wigglesworthia, tsetse harbors a secondary (S)-symbiont in midgut tissue. The specific function(s) of Wigglesworthia and S-symbionts are not known; however, since the ability to reproduce can be partially restored when the aposymbiotic tsetse receive a blood meal that is supplemented with B-complex vitamins (thiamine, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, folic acid, and biotin), it is suggested that the gut-tissue associated endosymbionts may play a role in metabolism that involves these compounds (Nogge, 1981). The recently sequenced genome of Wigglesworthia shows the presence of various biosynthetic pathways for vitamin metabolites (Akman et al., 2002). The 16S rDNA-based phylogeny of Wigglesworthia characterized from eight different tsetse species displays concordance with their insect host species, indicating an ancient association for this bacterium with an ancestral tsetse that has subsequently radiated along with the host insect species (Chen et al., 1999b). The bacterium is not present in the ovaries, but may be transmitted to the intrauterine larvae of tsetse via its milk-gland secretions. Type species: Wigglesworthia glossinidia Aksoy 1995b, 849.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01172/abstract

Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Legionellales / Coxiellaceae / Coxiella Strictly intracellular bacteria, usually 0.2–0.4 µm × 0.4–1.0 µm. Best stained by Gimenez staining. They have no flagella or capsule. They live in close natural association with arthropod and vertebrate hosts. The genus includes Coxiella burnetii—the agent of Q fever—and endosymbionts of ticks and aquatic invertebrates. C. burnetii grows well in cultured cell lines and in the yolk sac of chicken embryos, where it undergoes a cycle of development with formation of an endospore-like body. Coxiella burnetii possesses two antigenic phases: natural virulent phase I and attenuated phase II, which is obtained after passage in cultured cell lines and yolk sac. The organism grows in vacuoles of the host cell rather than in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. C. burnetii phase I vacuoles share characteristics of late-stage, immature phagosomes whereas C. burnetii phase II vacuoles are bactericidal phagolysosomes. Highly resistant to chemical agents and elevated temperature. Coxiellae occur worldwide in ticks and various vertebrates, including humans.

Moraxella	Mo.rax.el' la. M.L. dim. -ella ending; M.L. fem. n. Moraxella named after V. Morax, a Swiss ophthalmologist who pioneered the recognition of the type species. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Pseudomonadales / Moraxellaceae / Moraxella Rods or cocci. The rods are often very short and plump, frequently approaching a coccus shape (1.0–1.5 × 1.5–2.5 µm); they usually occur in pairs and short chains (one plane of division). Variation in cell size, shape, and filament or chain formation is often seen in cultures, the pleomorphism being enhanced by lack of oxygen and by incubation temperatures above the optimum. The cocci are usually smaller (0.6–1.0 µm in diameter) and occur as single cells or in pairs with the adjacent sides flattened (differing planes of division); division in two planes at right angles to each other sometimes results in the formation of tetrads. Gram negative, but often with a tendency to resist Gram decolorization. Flagella are absent. Both rod-shaped and coccal species may be fimbriated. Swimming motility is absent, but surface-bound “twitching motility” has been observed in some rod-shaped species. Aerobic, but some strains may grow weakly under anaerobic conditions. May be encapsulated. Chemoorganotrophic. Most species are nutritionally fastidious and all grow on complex media; some are stimulated significantly by fatty acids (bile salts, Tween 80). Optimum temperature for growth, 33–35°C. Colonies are not pigmented. Oxidase positive (with either tetra- or dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine reagent). Usually catalase positive. No acid is produced from carbohydrates. Usually highly sensitive to penicillin. Parasitic on the mucous membranes of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Strains of the several species of this genus have been shown to be genetically closely related by transformation of the high-level streptomycin resistance marker (Bøvre and Hagen, 1981) as well as by transformation of nutritional markers (Juni et al., 1987, 1988; Juni, 1990). DNA–DNA hybridization studies have shown high relative interspecies binding ratios for DNAs from strains of the genus Moraxella (Tønjum et al., 1989). Species of Moraxella share 95% similarity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 40.0–47.5 (Tm, Bd, HPLC). Type species: Moraxella lacunata (Eyre 1900) Lwoff 1939, 173 (Bacillus lacunatus Eyre 1900, 5; (Moraxella (Moraxella) lacunata (Eyre 1900) Bøvre 1979, 404.)	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01204/abstract
Psychrobacter	Psy.chro' bac.ter. Gr. adj. psychros cold; M.L. masc. n. bacter rod; M.L. masc. n. Psychrobacter a rod that grows at low temperatures. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Pseudomonadales / Moraxellaceae / Psychrobacter Rods or cocci, 0.9–1.3 × 1.5–3.8 µm. Rods can vary in length from extremely short (coccobacilli) to relatively long. For some strains the rods tend to be somewhat swollen. Also observed to grow as cocci or coccobacilli. Nonpigmented. Colonies on heart infusion agar are usually cream-colored, smooth, and opaque. Gram negative; the stain frequently tends to be retained. Nonmotile, and aerobic. Most strains are psychrotrophic; they are able to grow at 5°C, have temperature optima near 20°C, and generally are unable to grow at 35–37°C. Strains able to grow well at 35–37°C usually cannot grow at 5°C. Grow well on most common complex media. Most strains can grow on a mineral-agar medium containing a single carbon and energy source and ammonium salts as the nitrogen source. Some strains form acid aerobically from D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, and L-rhamnose. They are halotolerant and grow in the presence of 6.5% or greater NaCl. Many strains are radiation resistant. Oxidase positive. Catalase positive. Many strains are competent for natural genetic transformation. Have been isolated from the open sea, the deep sea, sea ice, ornithogenic soils, skins and gills of fish, skins of poultry, various food products, irradiated foods, air contaminants, and from a variety of human sources. Not known to be clinically significant. Cultures of Psychrobacter can be maintained in the same manner as for cultures of Acinetobacter, as described above. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 41–50.7. Type species: Psychrobacter immobilis Juni and Heym 1986b, 388.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01205/abstract
Azomonas	A.zo.mo' nas. Gr. adj. a not; Gr. n. zoê life; Gr. n. azoê not sustaining life, nitrogen Gr. n. monas a unit, monad; M.L. fem. n. Azomonas nitrogen monad. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Pseudomonadales / Pseudomonadaceae / Azomonas Cells are 2.0 μm or more in diameter, of variable length and shape, although usually 2.5–3.5 μm in length and generally ellipsoidal- to rod-shaped. They cannot easily be distinguished from cells of Azotobacter. Cells may occur singly, in pairs, or in clumps. Motile by peritrichous, lophotrichous, or polar flagella. Gram negative, but sometimes Gram variable, depending on culture age. Cysts are not formed in aging cultures. All species fix atmospheric nitrogen under aerobic conditions. Alternative nitrogenases containing vanadium (nitrogenase-2) or iron (nitrogenase-3) only may be synthesized in Mo-deficient media. Cultures can grow both aerobically and microaerobically. Chemoorganotrophic. Sugars, alcohols, and organic acids are used as carbon sources. Ammonium salts and sometimes nitrate (A. insignis only) are used as nitrogen sources; amino acids are not used. Water-soluble and fluorescent pigments are produced by nearly all strains. Species are catalase-positive. The optimum pH for nitrogen fixation is close to neutrality, but certain strains can also fix nitrogen at a pH of 4.6–4.8. Species are isolated from water or soil. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 52–58.6.

Azotobacter	A.zo.to.bac' ter. Fr. n. azote nitrogen; M.L. masc. n. bacter the equivalent of Gr. neut. n. bactrum a rod or staff; M.L. masc. n. Azotobacter a nitrogen rod. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Pseudomonadales / Pseudomonadaceae / Azotobacter Cells range from straight rods with rounded ends to more ellipsoidal or coccoid, depending on the culture medium and age. Cells are up to 2 μm or more in diameter and 4 μm in length. A. paspali cells are usually longer, 5–10 µm in length, and can be filamentous, up to 60 µm long. Cells are usually single but may occur in pairs, irregular clumps (especially with A. paspali), or, more rarely, in chains of varying length. Encystment occurs during late stationary phase at low frequency or at high frequency after culturing on butanol. Motile with peritrichous flagella or nonmotile. Aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Nitrogen is fixed under microaerobic conditions (2% oxygen), under full aerobiosis, or after adaptation in hyperbaric oxygen. N2 fixation uses Mo-, V-, or Fe-containing nitrogenase enzymes, depending on the environmental metal supply. Water-soluble and water-insoluble pigments are produced by some strains of all species. Growth is heterotrophic; sugars, alcohols, and salts of organic acids are used as carbon sources. Ammonium salts, nitrate, and urea are used as sources of fixed nitrogen. Very few amino acids are used, probably due to a general deficiency in amino acid transport. The minimum pH for growth in the presence of fixed nitrogen sources ranges from 4.8 to 6.0 with maximum pH 8.5. The optimum pH for diazotrophic growth is 7.0–7.5. Most isolates are from soil, but a few are from water. One species (A. paspali) has been isolated only from roots of the tropical grass Paspalum notatum. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 63.2–67.5.

Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Thiotrichales / Thiotrichaceae / Achromatium Spherical to ovoid or cylindrical unicells with hemispherical ends. In natural populations, cells of widely different sizes appear. Cells vary in size from spheres of about 10 µm in diameter to giant cylindrical forms up to 30 × 125 µm (extremes are dividing stages); cells are on average 15 × 50 μm. Many size classes may be present within a sample. However, genetically different sub-populations that overlap in their dimensions can occur in a single habitat. Division of cells by binary constriction. Gram negative. Calcium carbonate (calcite) is deposited intracellularly. Additionally, the cells contain globules of S0. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: not known. Type species: Achromatium oxaliferum Schewiakoff 1893, 1.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01222/abstract
Beggiatoa	Beg.gi.a.to' a. M.L. fem. n. Beggiatoa a genus of bacteria; named in remembrance of F.S. Beggiato, a physician of Vicenza, (g.b. 1807), who authored the Delle Terme Euganea. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Thiotrichales / Thiotrichaceae / Beggiatoa Colorless cells, ~1.0–200 × 2.0–10.0 μm, occurring in filaments 5.0–10 cm in length. Filaments usually have a consistent width over the entire length. Freshwater strains mostly, if not universally, possess filament diameters less than 5.0 µm, whereas marine beggiatoas with filament diameters ranging from 1.0 to 200 µm have been observed microscopically. No strain wider than 5 µm has been isolated in axenic culture from any source. The filaments may contain up to 100 or more cells, and in rare cases, up to several thousand. Cells in filaments are cylindrical and are longer than they are wide in the thinner strains (i.e., those less than ~5 µm in diameter). In wider strains (i.e., those greater than ~7 µm in diameter), cells are usually disk-shaped and typically are wider than they are long. Filaments occur singly, in sheets of cottony masses on sediment surfaces, or in mats in which each filament retains its individuality. Reproduction is by transverse binary fission of cells within filaments; division occurs by septation, in which the peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membranes close like the iris of a diaphragm. Filament dispersion is via sacrificial cell death (necridial cells), filament breakage, or simple disintegration. In some strains, the disintegration of filaments occurs until mostly single or double cell units (hormogonia) exist; a hormogonium then can grow to become a filament. Cells contain inclusions of sulfur when grown in the presence of H2S and, for some strains, thiosulfate. Intracellular inclusions of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate or polyphosphate may be present, particularly in freshwater strains. Marine or brackish water strains having a filament diameter of >10 μm contain a large (~80% of the cell volume), central liquid vacuole that contains concentrated nitrate. Resting stages are not known. Attachment holdfasts or sheaths are not present. Capsules are not formed, but filaments usually produce a slime matrix. Gram negative. Filaments and hormogonia have gliding motility. No motility organelles are known. Aerobic or microaerophilic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism, with oxygen and, in some instance, nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Anaerobic growth is not proven with pure cultures, but may occur with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor for some strains studied in nature. Internally stored sulfur may also serve as an electron acceptor by freshwater strains for short-term maintenance in the absence of oxygen. Sulfate does not substitute as the terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic growth in strains thus far studied. Chemoorganotrophic (freshwater strains), and either facultatively or constitutively chemolithoautotrophic (marine strains). H2S or thiosulfate may be used as the electron donor for chemolithotrophic metabolism. Acetate is oxidized to CO2 by all freshwater strains tested thus far. Several C2, C3, and C4 organic acids and, sometimes, their amino acid equivalents are utilized as sole carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic growth. Growth factors are not required by most strains, although some strains may require vitamin B12. Gelatin and starch are not hydrolyzed. N2 is fixed by all freshwater and marine strains tested thus far. Nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, N2, or certain amino acids may be used as the sole nitrogen source. Oxidase positive. Catalase negative. Freshwater, estuarine, and marine strains are known. Beggiatoas are inherently gradient organisms, growing in horizontal layers in sediments at the interface between the underlying anoxic sulfide-liberating zone and the overlying oxic zone. Growth can occur in the range of 0–40°C. Obligately thermophilic strains have not been characterized, although some beggiatoas have been observed in high temperature runoffs associated with thermal springs, or in mats adjacent to thermal vents in the ocean floor. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 35–39. Type species: Beggiatoa alba (Vaucher 1803) Trevisan 1842, 56.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01223/abstract
Leucothrix	Leu' co.thrix. Gr. adj. leucus clear, light; Gr. n. thrix, trichis hair; M.L. fem. n. Leucothrix colorless hair. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Thiotrichales / Thiotrichaceae / Leucothrix Long filaments composed of short, cylindrical or ovoid cells (gonidia), cross-walls clearly visible, colorless, unbranched; typically uniform filaments may taper from base to apex, showing under some conditions an apical beady chain of gonidia connected from end to end. Filaments may attain a length of over 100 µm, and lengths of several hundred micrometers are not unusual (Harold and Stanier, 1955; Pringsheim, 1957). The filaments, particularly when attached to a substrate, may be somewhat tapered, with the apex being 2–3 µm and the base 5–6 µm in diameter (Harold and Stanier, 1955; Pringsheim, 1957; Brock, 1969). In nature, filaments are usually attached to solid substrates by means of inconspicuous holdfasts; stalks and sheaths absent. Filaments do not glide, but may wave sporadically from side to side. Dispersal by means of gonidia (single cells arising from cells of the filaments by rounding up, often released primarily from apices, but they may also be formed in an intercalary fashion); gonidia often, but not always, show jerky gliding motion on solid substrates. Rosette formation is a key diagnostic characteristic of the genus that is seen frequently in laboratory culture but less commonly in nature. The rosettes may be formed of gonidia or, after gonidial growth, of several or more filaments attached at their bases. Filaments in a laboratory culture often form true knots. These structures also occur in nature, but rarely. The organism morphologically resembles some filamentous cyanobacteria but does not form photosynthetic pigments. Gram negative. Strictly aerobic, heterotrophic. Aquatic; typically marine, although one freshwater strain has been reported. Strains require NaCl for growth; optimum concentration: about 1.5% NaCl; grows at concentrations of 0.3–6.0% NaCl. Most strains do not require growth factors. Optimum temperature: 25°C; maximum: 30–35°C; minimum: 0°C, forming visible colonies within 1–2 weeks. Strains from tropical waters are more stenothermal, not growing below 15°C. Catalase positive. Oxidase positive. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 46.9–51 (Brock and Mandel, 1966; Kelly and Brock, 1969a, b). Type species: Leucothrix mucor Oersted 1844, 44.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01224/abstract

Thiomargarita	Thi' o.mar.ga.ri' ta. Gr. n. thion (theion) sulfur; L. n. margarita pearl; M.L. fem. n. Thiomargarita sulfur pearl. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Thiotrichales / Thiotrichaceae / Thiomargarita Very large spherical cells held together like a string of pearls by a common gelatinous mucus. The cells are not joined to each other, which is the main difference to the closely related filamentous genera, Thioploca and Beggiatoa. Numerous sulfur inclusions occur in a thin outer layer of cytoplasm. The cells appear hollow due to a large central vacuole in which nitrate is stored. Most strings of cells are linear and typically contain 20–60 cells, but some are branched or coiled. Both single cells and strings of more than 100 cells occur. Nonmotile. Gram negative. Oxygen tolerant. Thiomargarita appear to have an autotrophic or mixotrophic, sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing metabolism, comparable to the large marine forms of Thioploca and Beggiatoa, which are its closest relatives according to partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Type species: Thiomargarita namibiensis Schulz, Brinkhoff, Ferdelman, Hernández Mariné, Teske and Jørgensen 1999b, 1325 (Effective publication: Schulz, Brinkhoff, Ferdelman, Hernández Mariné, Teske and Jørgensen 1999a, 493.)	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01226/abstract
Thioploca	Thi.o.plo' ca. Gr. neut. n. thion, theion sulfur; Gr. fem. n. ploke a braid, a twist; M.L. fem. n. Thioploca sulfur braid. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Thiotrichales / Thiotrichaceae / Thioploca Flexible, uniseriate, colorless filaments made up of numerous cells and enclosed by a common gelatinous sheath. Gram negative. Cells are disk-shaped or cylindrical, generally harbor sulfur inclusions in their cytoplasm, and are separated by distinct cross-walls. Cells of large marine Thioploca species appear hollow due to central vacuoles in which nitrate is stored. Individual filaments are of uniform diameter, often with tapered terminal cells. Filaments fall into distinct classes of different diameters, which represent different species. Filaments show independent gliding movement within a sheath. They can emerge from the end or from breaks in the sheath and may be found outside sheaths. Chemotactic. May be attracted by nitrate but avoid high oxygen and sulfide concentrations. Thioploca sheaths are mostly vertically orientated to allow the filaments to move between spatially separated pools of electron donor (sulfide) and acceptor (nitrate, possibly oxygen). The sheath surrounding several filaments is the main feature distinguishing the genus Thioploca from the similar, closely related genus Beggiatoa. Not in pure culture. Large, marine Thioploca species have an autotrophic or mixotrophic, sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing metabolism. By 16S rRNA, Thioploca is a member of the Gammaproteobacteria and is the closest relative of the genera Beggiatoa and Thiomargarita .

Nevskia	Nev' ski.a. M.L. fem. n. Nevskia from the Neva, a river in St. Petersburg. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Xanthomonadales / Xanthomonadaceae / Nevskia Cells elongated, rod shaped, usually slightly bent with acellular hyaline stalks (Figure 1). The stalks branch dichotomously because of binary fission of mature cells and the preference for laterally excreted slime material (Figure 2). Undisturbed and slowly growing cells form flat, rosette-like to bush-like microcolonies (Figure 3), up to 80 µm in diameter, on the surface of freshwater. Faster growth results in the formation of a thin surface pellicle without distinct stalks (Figure 4) and with slime all around the cells. Cells filled with numerous refractile globules (Figure 4) which consist mainly of polyhydroxyalkanoates. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative. In young cultures, some cells are motile by means of a polar flagellum: they are set free from the microcolonies and can start the development of new colonies (Figure 5). Strictly aerobic. Optimum growth temperature: 20–25°C. Chemoorganotrophic, with a broad range of organic compounds, having an oxidative type of metabolism. Colorless colonies on nutrient agar. Weak catalase activity, no cytochrome oxidase activity. Cytochromes of the b and c types are present. Originally found in the surface pellicle of an aquarium.

Xanthomonas	Xan.tho' mo.nas or Xan.tho.mo' nas. *Gr. adj. xanthus yellow; Gr. fem. n. monas unit, monad; M.L. fem. n. Xanthomonas yellow monad. Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria / Xanthomonadales / Xanthomonadaceae / Xanthomonas Straight rods, 0.4–0.6 × 0.8–2.0 μm, mostly single or in pairs, occasionally short chains, filaments rarely seen. Gram negative. Do not produce poly-β-hydroxybutyrate inclusions, nor have sheaths, prosthecae, or resting stages. Motile by a single polar flagellum. Obligately aerobic, having a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. No denitrification or nitrate reduction occurs. Colonies are usually yellow, smooth and butyrous, mucoid or viscid. The pigments are highly characteristic brominated aryl polyenes or “xanthomonadins”. A characteristic extracellular acidic heteropolysaccharide called xanthan is produced by most strains giving the viscous consistency. Growth is inhibited by 6% NaCl, 30% glucose, 0.01% lead acetate, methyl green, or thionin, and by 0.1% (and usually by 0.02%) triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. Catalase positive; oxidase negative or weak; urease not produced. H2S is usually produced, but not indole or acetoin. Acid is not produced in litmus milk or purple milk. Chemoorganotrophic; able to use various carbohydrates and salts of organic acids as sole carbon sources. Small amounts of acid are produced from many carbohydrates, but not from l-rhamnose, adonitol, sorbose, d-sorbitol, meso-inositol, or meso-erythritol. Metabolic activity is shown in Biolog GN microplate tests with d-fructose, d-glucose, d-mannose and methylpyruvate, but not with α-cyclodextrin, adonitol, D-arabitol, meso-erythritol, meso-inositol, xylitol, D-glucosaminate, γ-hydroxybutyrate, itaconate, sebacate, L-ornithine, L-pyroglutamate, D-serine, D,L-carnitine, γ-aminobutyrate, phenylethylamine, putrescine, 2-aminoethanol, or 2,3-butanediol. L-asparagine, L-glutamine, and glycine cannot be used as sole sources of both carbon and nitrogen. Among the nine fatty acids that predominate in whole cell preparations are 9-methyl decanoic acid (C11:0 iso), 3-hydroxy-9-methyl decanoic acid (C11:0 iso 3OH), and 3-hydroxy-11-methyl dodecanoic acid (C13:0 iso 3OH), which are highly characteristic of this genus. The ubiquinone that is present has eight isoprene units. Spermidine is the main polyamine; spermine is usually detectable, but not 2-hydroxyputrescine or 1,3-diaminopropane. Species so far described are plant pathogens or are plant associated. The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 63.3–69.7 (Tm). Type species: Xanthomonas campestris (Pammel 1895) Dowson 1939, 190, emend.

Brachyspira	Bra.chy.spi'ra. Gr. adj. brachys short; L. fem. n. spira a coil, spiral; N.L. fem. n. Brachyspira a short spiral, describing a bacterium that resembles a short spiral. Spirochaetes / Spirochaetia / Spirochaetales / Brachyspiraceae / Brachyspira Brachyspira spirochetes are helical shaped bacteria with regular coiling patterns. Cells measure 2–11 µm by 0.2–0.4 µm. Unicellular, but dividing pairs and occasional chains of three or more cells can be observed in growing cultures. Under unfavorable growth conditions, spherical or round bodies are formed. Gram-stain negative. Obligately anaerobic, aerotolerant. Cell ends may be blunt or pointed. Cells have a typical spirochete cell ultrastructure, consisting of an outer sheath, helical protoplasmic cylinder, and internal flagella in the space between the protoplasmic cylinder and outer sheath. Brachyspire cells have 8–30 flagella per cell depending on the species (flagellar number usually correlates with cell size and species of smaller cells have fewer flagella). Flagella attach subterminally in equal numbers at each cell end, wrap around the protoplasmic cylinder, and their free ends overlap in the middle of the cells. Flexing and creeping motility at 22°C; translational movement in liquids at 37–42°C. Cultured anaerobically on commercially available media (trypticase soy or brain heart infusion broths) containing a carbohydrate growth substrate and supplemented with defibrinated blood or animal (calf) serum. Grows at 36–42°C, optimally at 37–39°C. Population doubling times on glucose in broth cultures are 1–5 h (not reported for Brachyspira aalborgi). Chemoorganotrophic, using various carbohydrates for growth. Possess NADH oxidase for reducing molecular oxygen. Consume oxygen during growth in culture broth beneath a 1% oxygen atmosphere. Acetate, butyrate, H2, and CO2 are major endproducts of glucose metabolism. Higher amounts of H2 than CO2 are produced. Weakly hemolytic except for Brachyspira hyodysenteriae which exhibits β-hemolysis (strongly hemolytic). Associated with animal and human hosts. Some species are pathogenic. The genus Brachyspira is distinguished from other spirochete genera based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Brachyspira species share high 16S rRNA sequence similarity with each other. Species can be differentiated by DNA–DNA relative reassociation and MLEE (multilocus enzyme electrophoresis) analyses. Similar to other spirochete genera, Brachyspira is insensitive to the antibiotic rifampin. DNA G+C content (mol%): 24.5–27.1 (T m).

Leptospira	Lep.to.spi'ra. Gr. adj. leptos thin, narrow, fine; L. fem. n. spira a coil, helix; N.L. fem. n. Leptospira a thin helix or coil, referring to the morphology of the bacterium. Spirochaetes / Spirochaetia / Spirochaetales / Leptospiraceae / Leptospira Leptospira are long, thin, flexible rods, 0.1 μm in diameter and 6–12 μm in length, with a regular right-handed helical coiling pattern (Carleton et al., 1979). These bacteria are unicellular but may be observed as dividing pairs or short chains of three or more cells in actively growing cultures. Resting stages are not known, but long term survival in water, with the appearance of aggregates has been described (Trueba et al., 2004). Spherically shaped cells form under unfavorable growth conditions. Bacteria stain as Gram-negative. Due to the small diameter of these bacteria, unstained cells are not visible by bright-field microscopy. Dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy is required for visualization of unstained cells. These are highly motile aerobic or microaerophilic bacteria. Optimum growth temperature is 28–30°C, with a generation time of 6–16 h, although many primary pathogenic isolates may grow slower. Chemoorganotrophic bacteria that consume long-chain fatty acids and alcohols as primary carbon and energy sources, and carry out respiration with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Optimal growth occurs in semi-solid (0.1–0.2%) agar media. Growth on 1–2% solid agar results in the formation of clear to turbid surface or subsurface colonies. Colony formation is enhanced by the addition of pyruvate. Oxidase, catalase, and/or peroxidase-positive. Some strains are β-hemolytic. Some strains are pathogenic for humans and animals, while other strains are saprophytic and found in freshwater and marine environments.

Cells have tight regular or irregular spirals and one or more periplasmic flagella (axial fibrils or axial filaments) inserted at each end of the protoplasmic cylinder. Cytoplasmic filaments are seen in the protoplasmic cylinder just under the cytoplasmic membrane and running parallel with the periplasmic flagella. Under unfavorable cultural or environmental conditions, spherical cells are formed. These can also be seen in old cultures. Gram-stain-negative. Cells stain well with silver impregnation methods. Most species stain poorly, if at all, with Gram or Giemsa stain. Best observed with darkfield or phase-contrast microscopy. Motile. Cells have rotational movement in liquid media, and translational motion in media with high viscosity [e.g., those containing 1% (w/v) methyl cellulose]. In a semisolid or solid medium, cells exhibit a serpentine type movement, sometimes referred to as creeping motility. Strictly anaerobic or microaerophilic. Frank pathogens (Treponema pallidum subspecies, Treponema carateum, and the rabbit pathogen Treponema paraluiscuniculi) represent a closely related subset within this genus and are considered microaerophiles. Limited multiplication of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum strains has been obtained in a tissue culture system, but none of the pathogenic Treponema have been cultivated continuously in artificial media or in tissue culture. Chemo-organotrophs, using a variety of carbohydrates or amino acids for carbon and energy sources. Cultivated anaerobic species are catalase- and oxidase-negative. Some require long-chain fatty acids found in serum for growth, while other cultivated species require short-chain volatile fatty acids for growth. Host-associated. Pathogenic Treponema pallidum subspecies cause skin lesions, and Treponema pallidum (particularly subspecies pallidum) can cause systemic infections that, if untreated, can last for years to decades. Other species are found in the oral cavity, intestinal tract, and genital areas of humans or other mammals, and in the gut contents of wood-feeding insects. DNA G+C content (mol%): 37–54.

Synergistetes / Synergistia / Synergistales / Synergistaceae / Synergistes Gram-negative, nonmotile rods. Nonsporing, strictly anaerobic chemoorganotroph. Growth occurs in media that contain yeast extract plus any of a variety of peptones. Certain amino acids and/or pyridinediols are fermented and products formed from peptones include formate, acetate, propionate, H2, and ammonia. Carbohydrates are not fermented.

“Candidatus Phytoplasma”	Phy.to.plas'ma. Gr. masc. n. phytos a plant; Gr. neut. n. plasma something formed or molded, a form. Tenericutes / Mollicutes / Acholeplasmatales / incertae Sedis - Family II / “Candidatus Phytoplasma” Phytoplasmas (Sears and Kirkpatrick, 1994) are wall-less, nutritionally fastidious, phytopathogenic prokaryotes 0.2–0.8 µm in diameter that morphologically resemble members of the Mollicutes. Sequencing of nearly full-length PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes (Gundersen et al., 1994; Namba et al., 1993; Seemüller et al., 1994), combined with earlier studies (Kuske and Kirkpatrick, 1992b; Lim and Sears, 1989), provided the first comprehensive phylogeny of the organisms and showed that they constitute a unique, monophyletic clade within the Mollicutes. These organisms are most closely related to members of the genus Acholeplasma within the Anaeroplasma clade as defined by Weisburg et al. (1989). Sustained culture in cell-free media has not yet been demonstrated for any phytoplasma. Their genome sizes have been estimated to range from 530 to 1350 kb, and the G+C content of phytoplasma DNA is about 23–30 mol%. The presence of a characteristic oligonucleotide sequence in the 16S rRNA gene, CAA GAY BAT KAT GTK TAG CYG GDC T, and standard codon usage indicate that phytoplasmas represent a distinct taxon for which the name “Candidatus Phytoplasma” has been adopted by specialists in the molecular biology and pathogenicity of these and similar phytopathogenic organisms (IRPCM Phytoplasma/Spiroplasma Working Team – Phytoplasma Taxonomy Group, 2004). At present, the designation “Candidatus” must still be used for new types.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01259/abstract
Entomoplasma	En.to.mo.plas'ma. Gr. n. entomon insect; Gr. neut. n. plasma something formed or molded, a form; N.L. neut. n. Entomoplasma name intended to show association with insects. Tenericutes / Mollicutes / Entomoplasmatales / Entomoplasmataceae / Entomoplasma Cells are nonhelical and nonmotile, frequently pleomorphic and range in size from 200 to 1200 nm in diameter. Some cells exhibit short filamentous forms. Most species ferment glucose. Species possess the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar-phosphotransferase system. Organisms require serum or cholesterol for growth. The temperature range for growth ranges from 10 to 32°C, with the optimum usually at 30–32°C. The genome sizes range from 870 to 900 kbp (PFGE). All currently assigned species were isolated from insects or from plant surfaces where they were presumably deposited by insects. DNA G+C content (mol%): 27–34. Type species: Entomoplasma ellychniae Tully, Rose, Hackett, Whitcomb, Carle, Bové, Colflesh and Williamson (Tully et al., 1989) Tully, Bové, Laigret and Whitcomb 1993, 380VP (Mycoplasma ellychniae Tully, Rose, Hackett, Whitcomb, Carle, Bové, Colflesh and Williamson 1989, 288).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01260/abstract
Mesoplasma	Me.so.plas'ma. Gr. adj. mesos middle; Gr. neut. n. plasma something formed or molded, a form; N.L. neut. n. Mesoplasma middle form, name intended to denote a middle position with respect to sterol or cholesterol requirement. Tenericutes / Mollicutes / Entomoplasmatales / Entomoplasmataceae / Mesoplasma Cells are nonhelical and nonmotile, generally coccoid or short filamentous forms. Coccoid cells are usually 220–300 nm in diameter, but some cells in some species can be as large as 400–500 nm. Most strains ferment glucose and most, but not all, lack the ability to hydrolyze arginine. Species possess the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar-phosphotransferase system. Neither serum nor cholesterol is required for growth, but strains show sustained growth in a serum-free or cholesterol-free medium when the medium is supplemented with 0.04% PES. The optimum temperature for growth is usually near 28–32°C, with some strains able to grow well at temperatures as low as 23°C or as high as 37°C. Genome sizes range from 825 to 930 kbp (PFGE). DNA G+C content (mol%): 26–32. Type species: Mesoplasma florum (McCoy, Basham, Tully, Rose, Carle and Bové 1984) Tully, Bové, Laigret and Whitcomb 1993, 380VP (Acholeplasma florum McCoy, Basham, Tully, Rose, Carle and Bové 1984, 14).	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01261/abstract
Spiroplasma	Spi.ro.plas'ma. Gr. n. speira (L. transliteration spira) a coil, spiral; Gr. neut. n. plasma something formed or molded, a form; N.L. neut. n. Spiroplasma spiral form. Tenericutes / Mollicutes / Entomoplasmatales / Spiroplasmataceae / Spiroplasma Cells are pleomorphic, varying in size and shape from helical and branched nonhelical filaments to spherical or ovoid. The helical forms, usually 100–200 nm in diameter and 3–5 µm in length, generally occur during the exponential phase of growth and in some species persist during stationary phase. The cells of some species are short (1–2 µm). In certain cases, helical cells may be very tightly coiled, or the coils may show continuous variation in amplitude. Spherical cells ~300 nm in diameter and nonhelical filaments are frequently seen in the stationary phase, where they may not be viable, and in all growth phases in suboptimal growth media, where they may or may not be viable. In some species during certain phases, spherical forms may be the replicating form. Helical filaments are motile, with flexional and twitching movements, and often show an apparent rotatory motility. Fibrils are associated with the membrane, but flagellae, periplasmic fibrils, or other organelles of locomotion are absent. Fimbriae and pili observed on the cell surface of insect- and plant-pathogenic spiroplasmas are believed to be involved in host-cell attachment and conjugation (Ammar et al., 2004; Özbek et al., 2003), but not in locomotion. Cells divide by binary fission, with doubling times of 0.7–37 h. Facultatively anaerobic. The temperature growth range varies among species, from 5 to 41°C. Colonies on solid media are frequently diffuse, with irregular shapes and borders, a condition that reflects the motility of the cells during active growth (Figure 111). Colony type is strongly dependent on the agar concentration. Colony sizes vary from 0.1 to 4.0 mm in diameter. Colonies formed by nonmotile variants or mutants, or by cultures growing on inadequate media are typically umbonate with diameters of 200 µm or less. Some species, such as Spiroplasma platyhelix, have barely visible helicity along most of their length and display little rotatory or flexing motility. Colonies of motile, fast-growing spiroplasmas are diffuse, often with satellite colonies developing from foci adjacent to the initial site of colony development. Light turbidity may be produced in liquid cultures. Chemo-organotrophic. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolysis of arginine is variable. Urea, arbutin, and esculin are not hydrolyzed. Sterol requirements are variable. An optimum osmolality, usually in the range of 300–800 mOsm, has been demonstrated for some spiroplasmas. Media containing mycoplasma broth base, serum, and other supplements are required for primary growth, but after adaptation, growth often occurs in less complex media. Defined or semi-defined media are available for some species. Resistant to 10,000 U/ml penicillin. Insensitive to rifampicin, sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline. Isolated from the surfaces of flowers and other plant parts, from the guts and hemolymph of various insects and crustaceans, and from tick triturates. Also isolated from vascular plant fluids (phloem sap) and insects that feed on the fluids. Specific host associations are common. The type species, Spiroplasma citri, is pathogenic for citrus (e.g., orange and grapefruit), producing “stubborn” disease. Experimental or natural infections also occur in horseradish, periwinkle, radish, broad bean, carrot, and other plant species. Spiroplasma kunkelii is a maize pathogen. Some species are pathogenic for insects. Certain species are pathogenic, under experimental conditions, for a variety of suckling rodents (rats, mice, hamsters and rabbits) and/or chicken embryos. Genome sizes vary from 780 to 2220 kbp (PFGE). DNA G+C content (mol%): 24–31 (T m, Bd). Type species: Spiroplasma citri Saglio, L'Hospital, Laflèche, Dupont, Bové, Tully and Freundt 1973, 202AL.	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01262/abstract
Mycoplasma	My.co.plas'ma. Gr. masc. n. myces a fungus; Gr. neut. n. plasma something formed or molded, a form; N.L. neut. n. Mycoplasma fungus form. Tenericutes / Mollicutes / Mycoplasmatales / Mycoplasmataceae / Mycoplasma Pleomorphic cells, 300–800 nm in diameter, varying in shape from spherical, ovoid or flask-shaped, or twisted rods, to slender branched filaments ranging in length from 50 to 500 nm. Cells lack a cell wall and are bounded by a single plasma membrane. Gram-stain-negative due to the absence of a cell wall. Some have a complex internal cytoskeleton. Some have a specific tip structure that mediates attachment to host cells or other surfaces. Usually nonmotile, but gliding motility has been demonstrated in some species. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic. Optimum growth at 37°C is common, but permissive growth temperatures range from 20 to 45°C. Chemo-organotrophic, usually using either sugars or arginine as the major energy source. Require cholesterol or related sterols for growth. Colonies are usually less than 1 mm in diameter. The typical colony has a fried-egg appearance. The genome size of species examined ranges from 580 kbp to about 1350 kbp. The codon UGA encodes tryptophan in all species examined. Commensals or pathogens in a wide range of vertebrate hosts. DNA G+C content (mol%): 23–40.

Unusual pH required for growth (about 6.0–6.5). Optimal incubation temperature for examined species is 35–37°C. Chemo-organotrophic. Like Mycoplasma, species of Ureaplasma lack oxygen-dependent, NADH oxidase activity. Unlike Mycoplasma, species of Ureaplasma lack hexokinase or arginine deiminase activities but have a unique and obligate requirement for urea and produce potent ureases that hydrolyze urea to CO2 and NH3for energy generation and growth. Genome sizes range from 760 to 1170 kbp (PFGE). Commensals or opportunistic pathogens in vertebrate hosts, primarily birds and mammals (mainly primates, ungulates, and carnivores).

Cenarchaeum = genus of relatively recent (derived nonthermophilic phenotype) and common (non-“extremophilic”) Archaea. Thaumarchaeota / Nitrososphaeria / Candidatus Cenarchaeales / Candidatus Cenarchaeaceae / Candidatus Cenarchaeum The species Candidatus Cenarchaeum symbiosum of the genus Candidatus Cenarchaeum constitutes the sole archaeal symbiont of the temperate marine sponge Axinella mexicana. It represented the first tractable organism of the so-called mesophilic crenarchaeota, now Nitrososphaeria, until pure isolates and enrichment cultures became available. It was also the source of the first assembled full genome of the Nitrososphaeria. Physiological and genomic analyses suggest that representatives of this genus are aerobic, psychrophilic, and capable of a chemolithoautotrophic metabolism, by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite. The environmental distribution of the genus so far has been confined to sponge-associated communities. DNA G + C content (mol%): 57.74.

Nitrosotalea a nitrite-forming slender rod. Thaumarchaeota / Nitrososphaeria / Candidatus Nitrosotaleales / Candidatus Nitrosotaleaceae / Candidatus Nitrosotalea Since the late nineteenth century, aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria have been cultivated from a wide range of environments. In the past decade, ammonia-oxidizing archaea belonging to the phylum Thaumarchaeota have also been recognized as an abundant group of organisms that contribute to ammonia oxidation in the majority of terrestrial and aquatic habitats investigated. One lineage within the Thaumarchaeota, currently represented by the cultivated isolates “Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra” and “Candidatus Nitrosotalea sp. Nd2,” is abundant in acidic soil environments. Both isolates are obligate acidophiles, growing optimally around pH 5.0. These organisms are the first and only cultivated autotrophic ammonia oxidizers that do not grow at neutral pH. They possess ≤90% 16S rRNA gene identity with other cultivated thaumarchaea in genera such as Ca. Nitrosopumilus, Nitrososphaera and Ca. Nitrosocaldus, and Ca. Nitrosotalea isolates are therefore representatives of a novel genus within the Thaumarchaeota. Ca. Nitrosotalea are small, rod-shaped cells with angular and electron dense poles. They are obligately aerobic autotrophs and require ammonia as their sole energy source.

Crenarchaeota / Thermoprotei / Fervidicoccales / Fervidicoccaceae / Fervidicoccus Members of the genus Fervidicoccus are extremely thermophilic, obligately anaerobic, and organotrophic microorganisms of the phylum Crenarchaeota. 16S rRNA genes of closely related microorganisms were found in environmental DNA samples from terrestrial hot springs of Kamchatka and Kuril Islands (Russia), Iceland, Yellowstone National Park (USA), and New Zealand with temperatures of 55–84°C, where they can make up a significant fraction of the microbial community. At present, the only cultivated representative of the Fervidicoccus genus is Fervidicoccus fontis, isolated from the Treshchinnyi hot spring of Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka. It is an anaerobic organotroph growing optimally on peptides in the presence of 20–50 mg/l yeast extract at 65–70°C and pH 6.0. Elemental sulfur, if present, is reduced to H2S; however, it is not obligately required for growth. H2 partially inhibits the growth of Fervidicoccus fontis. Thus, phenotypically Fervidicoccus fontis resembles other anaerobic organotrophic archaea of the phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, such as desulfurococci and thermococci, but differs from them by its lower growth temperature. Complete genome analysis of Fervidicoccus fontis confirmed a distinct phylogenetic position of this group. DNA G + C content (mol%): 37.5 (genome).

They grow at a wide range of salt concentrations, and in contrast to most other genera within the Halobacteria, they survive at low salt concentrations and can recover after prolonged exposure to <0.2M NaCl. They are chemoorganotrophic and can grow on a wide range of substrates, including single and complex carbon sources. Acid is produced from carbohydrates. Polar lipids are diphytanyl diether derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, the methyl ester of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate (shown to be present in most species), and two to five glycolipids. Currently, the genus consists of four species, Haladaptatus paucihalophilus (the type species of the genus), Hap. cibarius, Hap. litoreus, and Hap. pallidirubidus. The DNA G + C content is 54.0–60.5 mol%. Isolates have been recovered from saline springs, saline soils, solar salterns, and fermented seafood. DNA G + C content (mol%): 54.0–61.8.

Haloquadratum	Ha.lo.qua.dra'tum. Gr. masc. n. hals, halos salt, L. neut. n. quadratum square, N.L. neut. n. Haloquadratum salt square. Euryarchaeota / Halobacteria / Haloferacales / Haloferacaceae / Haloquadratum The haloarchaeal species Haloquadratum walsbyi, the only member described of the genus Haloquadratum, dominates NaCl saturated thalassic lakes worldwide. These microbes are unique due to their peculiar flattened and square shape (like a postage stamp), and they contain gas vesicles and granules of poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate. They are red-pink pigmented due to the presence of bacterioruberin carotenoids and bacteriorhodopsin. Reaching populations of up to 108 cells ml−1 they are the most successful halophile. However, pure cultures are extremely fastidious to obtain and grow very slowly in the laboratory. Even 10 years after the isolation of the first two strains, the existence of proven protocols for its isolation and its massive abundance in hypersaline ecosystems, only four more strains of Haloquadratum have been isolated. Most of the information available about this microbe derives from genome and metagenome sequencing. The genomes of the first two pure cultures indicate that they are photoheterotrophs like most members of the class Halobacteria. Their success may be due to the efficient exploitation of solar energy through rhodopsins and their large surface to volume ratio that would facilitate light and organic nutrient harvesting in the brine. DNA G + C content (mol%): 47.9 Type species: Haloquadratum walsbyi.

Halorhabdus spp. are extremely halophilic, and cells quickly lyse in water. Magnesium is either not required or only necessary in very small amounts (0.002 M). They are thermotolerant, with growth in the range 15–57.5°C. Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is produced. The respiratory lipoquinone present is MK-8(VIII-H2); MK-8 is also present in some strains. Different types of diphytanyl ether derivatives are the major polar lipids; phosphatidylglycerol sulfate is always absent. Three species of the genus Halorhabdus have been described and were isolated from a variety of hypersaline environments: sediments in hypersaline lakes (Hrd. utahensis, the type species of the genus), deep-sea brines (Hrd. tiamatea), and salt mine boreholes (Hrd. rudnickae).
